**Figure 1. Overview of Bench2Dex.** Bench2Dex is a simulation benchmark for bimanual dexterous manipulation with 26 tasks, 12 robot embodiments, and about 1.3K human-teleoperated demonstration trajectories, collected across a range of objects and scenes. It supports teleoperated demonstration collection and 8 data modalities: RGB images, depth maps, joint states, object states, a shared visuo-tactile representation, 2D/3D bounding boxes, and occupancy grids. With this multimodal data and controlled domain randomization, Bench2Dex supports evaluation of policy performance, robustness, and generalization on everyday bimanual manipulation tasks. 

#### **Abstract** 

Tactile sensing provides contact information that can be difficult to infer from vision alone, but tactile

hardware for dexterous hands has not converged to a common design. Dexterous hands differ in finger structure, contact surfaces, and sensor layouts, while simulated tactile signals still differ from measurements produced by physical sensors. These factors make it difficult to study visuo-tactile manipulation across diverse dexterous hands within a consistent experimental setting. We present **Bench2Dex** , a simulation benchmark for visuo-tactile bimanual manipulation across 12 dexterous hands. We adapt existing robot models with a shared simulated tactile interface that converts local contact geometry into image-like tactile observations. The interface provides a consistent observation format across different hand morphologies without attempting to reproduce the output of a specific physical tactile sensor. Bench2Dex includes 26 bimanual manipulation tasks that involve tool use, articulated-object interaction, and multi-stage manipulation, together with about 1.3K human-teleoperated demonstrations. The benchmark provides synchronized visual, tactile, proprioceptive, action, and object-state observations, together with executable task metrics. For robustness, we group seven perturbation types into invariance axis, where the correct action does not change, and equivariance axis, where the correct action changes together with the perturbation. We evaluate ACT, Diffusion Policy, _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5, and GR00T N1.5 on Bench2Dex and report their performance and failure modes. Bench2Dex is meant as a platform for studying visuo-tactile learning across dexterous hands. It does not assume that simulated tactile observations can replace real tactile sensing; it offers a shared setting for algorithm development while tactile hardware and simulation models are still evolving. All code for training, inference, and teleoperation is open-sourced. 

## **1 Introduction** 

Dexterous manipulation is a core capability for embodied agents: it lets robots interact with tools, articulated objects, and everyday environments through direct physical contact [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Driven by large-scale teleoperation datasets [6, 7, 8, 9], simulation benchmarks [4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], cross-embodiment data efforts [17, 18], and vision-language-action policies [19, 20, 21, 22], robot learning has made steady progress in scale, task coverage, and reproducibility. 

However, most manipulation benchmarks and datasets are still built around one fixed robot platform, one gripper or hand design, or a narrow set of sensing modalities [4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Some large datasets now cover multiple embodiments, but their evaluation protocols are not built to compare dexterous manipulation policies across different arm-hand designs and contact surfaces [17, 18, 23]. 

This gap matters most for visuo-tactile learning. Vision-based tactile sensors output image-like contact signals that depend closely on fingertip shape and sensor layout [24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. As a result, tactile signals recorded on one hand do not transfer directly to another hand, and, to our knowledge, no existing benchmark supports visuo-tactile data collection across multiple dexterous hands under one setting [24, 29, 30, 31]. 

A benchmark that spans many embodiments is useful for more than coverage. Different hands have different kinematic limits, finger designs, and contact patterns, and these differences affect grasp strategy, tool use, and long-horizon task execution [1, 2, 29, 30, 32, 33]. A policy that works on one hand and fails on another is not necessarily a weaker policy – it may simply not have been exposed to that hand’s shape during training. In the same way, a shared visuo-tactile setting helps check whether a policy makes general use of contact information, rather than fitting to one hand’s tactile layout [24, 25, 26]. 

Large-scale robot data [6, 7, 17, 18], dexterous grasping and bimanual manipulation [1, 2, 32, 33, 34], and teleoperation systems [8, 9, 29, 30] have each advanced on their own, but largely as separate lines of work. **To our knowledge, there is still no benchmark that combines diverse bimanual dexterous embodiments, teleoperated simulation, cross-embodiment visuo-tactile data collection, long-horizon tool-use tasks, executable progress evaluation, and generalization testing in one setting** [24, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. 

To address this gap, we introduce **Bench2Dex** , a simulation benchmark for teleoperated bimanual dexterous manipulation built on **Isaac Lab** [37, 38]. Bench2Dex covers 12 robot embodiments and 26 long-horizon tasks built around tool use, multi-stage interaction, and daily manipulation scenarios. Human operators collect 1.3K teleoperated trajectories in simulation, and the benchmark records synchronized observations across eight modalities, including visual, geometric, proprioceptive, action, and visuo-tactile signals. Each task has a structured scene description and is scored with executable success and progress conditions. Together, these parts connect teleoperated data collection, multimodal observation, and evaluation within one framework.

We group the seven robustness perturbation types into two kinds. Tabletop texture, lighting conditions, scene background, camera pose, and distractor objects change the input but not the task: the object and the goal are unchanged, so the correct action should stay the same, and a drop in success rate reflects sensitivity to nuisance factors rather than a harder task. Object pose and table height change the task geometry: the correct action should change together with the perturbation, so success here instead reflects whether the policy adapts correctly. We refer to the first group as invariance axis and the second as equivariance axis, following how these properties are defined for learned policies more generally. Reporting the two groups separately, rather than as one aggregate robustness score, lets a drop in success rate be traced to nuisance sensitivity or to genuine task generalization, instead of being folded into a single number. 

Dexterous-hand hardware has not converged on a common finger or sensor design, and the tactile interface in Bench2Dex does not reproduce the output of any specific physical sensor. We do not treat this as a reason to wait. A shared simulation setting lets the community study visuo-tactile perception and cross-embodiment dexterous manipulation under matched tasks and conditions now, and the interface can be revised as tactile hardware and simulation models mature. **In sum, our main contributions are as follows:** 

- We introduce **Bench2Dex** , a simulation benchmark for bimanual dexterous manipulation featuring 12 robot embodiments, 26 long-horizon tasks, and 1.3K human-teleoperated demonstrations. **We open-source the teleoperation systems for all embodiments.** 

- We develop a **_unified visuo-tactile interface_** that maps local contact geometry to a common image-like tactile representation across 12 dexterous hands with diverse finger structures and sensor layouts. Together with vision, proprioception, and action signals, it provides synchronized data across eight modalities. 

- We establish an evaluation suite covering task completion, stage-level progress, and execution quality, with robustness tests spanning seven perturbation types along two axes: **_invariance_** , where correct actions remain unchanged, and **_equivariance_** , where they transform with the perturbation. 

- We benchmark ACT, Diffusion Policy, _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5, and GR00T N1.5 on Bench2Dex, highlighting the gap between matched scenes and controlled scene perturbations in bimanual dexterous manipulation. 

## **2 Related Work** 

### **2.1 Manipulation Benchmarks and Datasets** 

Simulation benchmarks such as Meta-World [10], RLBench [11], robosuite [45], CALVIN [12], LIBERO [13], and ManiSkill3 [46] provide standardized evaluation for multi-task manipulation, while MimicGen [47] and RoboTwin [48] reduce demonstration cost through data generation. Large-scale real-world datasets— BridgeData V2 [7], Open X-Embodiment [17], DROID [6], RoboMIND 2.0 [41], and AgiBot World [49]—have fueled generalist policies such as Octo [21], OpenVLA [22], and _𝜋_ 0 [50]. Recent robustness benchmarks— RoboCasa [4], RoboCasa365 [43], GemBench [51], THE COLOSSEUM [52], RoboTwin 2.0 [31], RL-

Bench2 [39], and MuJoCo Manipulus [42]—test controlled distribution shifts. This line of work relies on parallel-jaw grippers, so it provides no multi-finger dexterous hand or vision-based tactile support, and its evaluation protocols do not compare dexterous hand morphologies or visuo-tactile sensing configurations. 

### **2.2 Dexterous and Bimanual Manipulation Benchmarks** 

A separate line of benchmarks targets dexterous or bimanual manipulation specifically, but each covers only part of the properties in Table 1. Bi-DexHands [32] focuses on reinforcement learning with dual Shadow Hands but provides no visual observations, and BiCoord [44] studies bimanual coordination without dexterous hands. DexMimicGen [33] generates demonstrations for 3 dexterous embodiments across 9 tasks, but does not include tool use or tactile sensing. RealMirror [40] supports a single dexterous embodiment across 5 tool-use tasks, without tactile sensing. DexJoCo [34] supports 2 embodiments and 11 tasks with tool use, but omits tactile data. DexVerse [36] covers 19 tool-use tasks on a single dexterous embodiment with teleoperated demonstrations, but likewise does not include tactile sensing. None of these benchmarks combines multiple dexterous embodiments with tactile sensing. 

### **2.3 Dexterous Data Collection and Teleoperation** 

Foundational work on Adroit [53], OpenAI in-hand manipulation [54], and DexYCB [55] established dexterous hands as challenging platforms for robot learning. Recent efforts scale dexterous data through synthetic grasps [56, 57], generative demonstrations [33], hand-motion reconstruction from egocentric videos [58] and human-to-robot transfer [59, 60, 61]. Teleoperation systems such as Mobile ALOHA [9], ALOHA 2 [62], UMI [63], and FastUMI [64] advance bimanual data collection but use parallel-jaw grippers, while AnyTeleop [29] and From One Hand to Multiple [30] address cross-hand retargeting at the algorithmic level. These methods improve how dexterous demonstrations are generated or collected, but each is evaluated on its own custom setup rather than a shared benchmark spanning multiple embodiments. 

### **2.4 Tactile Sensing and Benchmarking for Manipulation** 

Vision-based tactile sensors, such as GelSight [25, 65], DIGIT [26], TACTO [27], and Taxim [28], convert local contact deformation into image-like tactile observations, enabling robots to reason about contact states that are difficult to infer from external vision alone. Recent studies have used tactile feedback for insertion, grasp adjustment, and contact-rich manipulation [66, 67, 68], while newer work further explores reusable tactile skins [69], self-supervised touch representations [70], visuo-tactile pretraining and policy learning [24, 71, 72], and tactile-conditioned diffusion or vision-language-action policies [73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78]. 

Complementary benchmark efforts have begun to standardize tactile evaluation at different levels. EgoTactile pairs egocentric video with full-hand pressure supervision, RCT evaluates contact-sequence-aware generalization across materials and sensors, HT-Bench targets full-hand tactile representation learning over 226 tasks, and HRDexDB aligns human and robot grasp sequences for cross-embodiment study [79, 80, 81, 82]. At the closed-loop policy level, roto 2.0 evaluates tactile-only reinforcement learning across four dexterous morphologies, TactiDex measures physically grounded contact in real-world dexterous manipulation, and SoftVTBench introduces goal- and safety-aware evaluation for visuo-tactile deformableobject manipulation [35, 83, 84]. Among the benchmarks in Table 1, RoboMIND 2.0 [41] is the only other one with vision-based tactile support, but it uses parallel-jaw grippers across six embodiments, so its tactile signal is not organized around a shared representation for heterogeneous dexterous hand morphologies. These efforts address complementary slices of tactile learning, but do not jointly target a common tactile representation spanning heterogeneous bimanual dexterous embodiments and long-horizon tasks. 

Bench2Dex instead focuses on a unified cross-embodiment tactile representation by reconstructing tactile contact surfaces from different hand meshes and converting contact depth into a common surface-aligned tactile-map format, building on geometry-consistent penetration-depth encoding [85]. This enables consistent tactile data acquisition and evaluation across diverse dexterous embodiments.

As summarized in Table 1, no existing benchmark jointly supports diverse bimanual dexterous embodiments, teleoperated demonstration collection, vision-based tactile sensing, tool use, and articulated-object interaction. Bench2Dex fills this gap with a single simulation pipeline that unifies multiple bimanual dexterous embodiments under one teleoperation interface, records synchronized multimodal observations including tactile data, and evaluates policies under controlled distribution shifts. 

## **3 Bench2Dex Benchmark** 

Bench2Dex is designed as a full benchmark pipeline rather than a task collection alone. As shown in Figure 1, it connects task construction, human teleoperation, multimodal data collection and executable evaluation into a unified simulation framework. This section describes the benchmark components used to generate data and evaluate policies. 

### **3.1 Online Teleoperation Setup** 

Bench2Dex uses human teleoperation to collect demonstrations for long-horizon bimanual dexterous manipulation. The teleoperation system is integrated directly into the Isaac Lab simulation loop, so each episode is recorded together with the commanded action, robot state, object state, camera observations, task metadata, and success or metric signals. The recording pipeline is designed to introduce minimal per-step overhead, preserving the responsiveness required for real-time human teleoperation. Teleoperation therefore serves not only as a data collection tool, but also as a practical feasibility check for whether a task can be executed under a given robot embodiment and scene configuration. 

The operator controls the robot through a Manus glove and an ARKit wrist-tracking stream. The Manus runtime provides a 25-node hand skeleton through shared memory; the system converts it to 21 MediaPipe-style hand keypoints and uses DexPilot retargeting to solve target joint angles for the active robot hand. The same retargeting interface is configured for twelve dexterous hand embodiments, giving all supported hands a unified teleoperation and data-collection protocol. Arm motion is controlled separately: ARKit provides wrist translation and orientation cues, while a Pinocchio-based closed-loop inverse-kinematics controller maps the desired wrist pose to the corresponding arm joint targets. The hand and arm targets are then merged into a single absolute joint-position command for the full bimanual robot. 

During recording, Bench2Dex stores the action to be executed at the next simulation step, followed by the resulting post-step observations and evaluator state. Before starting or saving a trajectory, the robot is moved to a home configuration, which reduces discontinuities between demonstrations and resets the teleoperation filters and wrist anchors. 

### **3.2 Offline Multimodal Data Acquisition** 

The lightweight online recording described above captures only the essential motion stream. The remaining modalities—multi-view RGB-D images, object bounding boxes, occupancy labels, and surface-aligned tactile observations—are generated by an offline replay pipeline that reconstructs each episode in simulation and renders the full sensor suite. This decoupling of teleoperation from expensive rendering is a key design choice: the human operator session is kept short, while the replay step can be parallelized, re-run with updated sensor configurations, or selectively applied to a subset of episodes. 

**Replay pipeline.** For each recorded episode, the replay pipeline loads the saved object initial states and robot joint trajectory, then replays the simulation with the same random seed to ensure deterministic reproduction. Multi-view RGB-D images are rendered from the six calibrated camera viewpoints (chest, overhead, stereo left, stereo right, left wrist, right wrist). Semantic and instance segmentation labels are extracted from the rendered outputs, occupancy grids are voxelized from the scene geometry, and object bounding boxes in both 2D image coordinates and 3D world coordinates are generated from the projected object meshes. The HDF5 writer keeps camera calibration, action metadata, frame validity, and task metadata together with these 

5 

observations, making replay, evaluation, and cross-embodiment comparison consistent across tasks and robot hands. Tactile observations are generated during the same replay pass using the surface-aligned ray-casting pipeline described in Section 3.3.

**Figure 2. Unified surface-aligned tactile acquisition for diverse robotic hands.** Contact surfaces are reconstructed for twelve robot-hand morphologies, and a shared surface-aligned ray-casting pipeline maps the heterogeneous hand geometries into a common image-like tactile representation. 

### **3.3 Unified Visuo-Tactile Data Acquisition** 

Contact is central to bimanual dexterous manipulation. After a robot grasps a tool, pushes an articulated part, or stabilizes an object with the other hand, **_the most informative interaction is often hidden from external cameras._** Prior systems such as TACTO [27] and Taxim [28] established image-based tactile simulation, while TacMap [85] introduced a geometry-consistent penetration-depth representation over contact surfaces. Drawing on these paradigms, we develop a unified surface-aligned tactile acquisition layer for Bench2Dex. Our contribution is a cross-embodiment interface that combines reconstructed hand contact surfaces, a shared site registry, consistent encoding, and offline replay to expose heterogeneous robot hands through one tactile data representation. 

As illustrated in Figure 2, for each tactile site _𝑠_ , our acquisition layer uses a precomputed local surface map derived from the hand contact mesh. Each grid cell corresponds to a fixed surface point with an associated inward-facing normal. During replay, rays are cast from these surface points along the inward normals against task-object meshes, so the first-hit depth measures how far an object surface has penetrated past the nominal contact surface; the contact-consistency-filtered depth is then encoded as an 8-bit tactile image **T** _𝑠,𝑡_ ∈{0 _, . . . ,_ 255}<sup>_𝐻_×</sup><sup>_𝑊_</sup> for site _𝑠_ at time _𝑡_ . Bench2Dex also retains the metric ray depth and a binary contact-validity mask, while the compact tactile stream applies a piecewise depth encoding and spatial smoothing. The complete signal semantics and quantization procedure are provided in Appendix C.1. This representation converts sparse geometric contact into an image-like signal that can be processed by visual encoders or fused with RGB-D, proprioception, and object-state observations. 

**A key design goal is embodiment consistency.** Bench2Dex uses one tactile acquisition paradigm for the twelve bimanual robot-hand embodiments included in the benchmark, while preserving the local contact 

6 

geometry of each hand. To achieve this, we rebuilt the tactile contact-surface meshes for each benchmark hand and converted them into surface point-and-normal assets, provided in Appendix C. A tactile registry then maps each robot embodiment to its tactile site names, surface assets, resolution, normal convention, and site-body attachment rules, avoiding hand-specific branching in the data collection code. 

### **3.4 Datasets and Policy** 

**Dataset.** Bench2Dex contains about 1.3K human-teleoperated demonstrations across 26 long-horizon tasks and 12 bimanual dexterous embodiments. Each trajectory is replayed into a unified HDF5 record with synchronized RGB-D observations, joint states and actions, object states, surface-aligned tactile maps, 2D/3D bounding boxes, and occupancy grids. 

**Policy.** We evaluate ACT [8], Diffusion Policy (DP) [86], _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 [87], and GR00T N1.5 [88]. ACT and DP are trained from scratch using multi-view RGB and joint-state observations, whereas _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 and GR00T N1.5 are fully fine-tuned from pretrained checkpoints. For the pretrained policies, state/action projections are adapted to each embodiment where required, with shape-incompatible or newly added parameters initialized randomly. Complete training configurations are provided in Appendix F. 

### **3.5 Evaluation Metrics** 

Bench2Dex uses a unified evaluation suite that separates primary benchmark scores from task-specific diagnostics. Unless stated otherwise, we use a reach-and-stop protocol: each task provides an executable terminal predicate, and an episode terminates successfully only after that predicate remains true for its configured dwell time (0.5 s by default). Rollouts otherwise terminate at the evaluation budget or when evaluation cannot proceed. The protocol, step budget, dwell time, resolved seed, and sampled generalization parameters are retained for each episode. 

The primary completion metric is stable success rate, 



where _𝑆𝑒_ = 1 only when the terminal predicate stably holds, rather than at a transient frame. To characterize partial progress on long-horizon tasks, the benchmark also provides the _latched stage completion rate_ (LSCR), 



where _𝐾𝑒_ is the number of stages and _𝐿𝑒,𝑘_ = 1 if stage _𝑘_ is reached at any time while its declared dependencies are satisfied by previously latched or concurrently reached stages. Latching prevents progress from being erased when an early predicate is intentionally reversed by a later action, such as closing door after opening it. 

For efficiency analysis, the benchmark provides mean time to stable success over successful episodes, together with SR so that this conditional quantity is not interpreted independently of completion. Supported safety diagnostics include safe success rate, hard-violation rate, drop rate, tracked-object high-speed violation rate, and the fraction of executed steps containing a task-level violation. A hard violation is a configured drop or high-speed event; high speed is a severe-motion proxy rather than a contact-force or collision measurement, while joint-limit observations remain auxiliary diagnostics. For generalization analysis, episodes are grouped into the `None` , `Equi.` , `Inv.` , and `Full` channels, for which the benchmark can compute SR, sample counts, and, when the baseline SR is nonzero, the success-rate ratio relative to `None` . Additional completion, progress, efficiency, safety, grasp, tool-use, motion, and reproducibility diagnostics are described in Appendix E. 

### **3.6 Generalization Strategy** 

Bench2Dex evaluates whether a policy learns task-level manipulation concepts rather than memorizing a fixed simulator instance. Each evaluation keeps the semantic goal, object set, and success conditions unchanged 

7 

while controlling two groups of scene factors. Scene background, tabletop texture, lighting conditions, distractor objects, and camera pose are treated as **Invariance** factors because they alter task-irrelevant visual conditions without changing the intended task behavior. Object pose and table height are treated as **Equivariance** factors because they alter task-relevant geometry and therefore require corresponding changes in reaching, grasping, and contact trajectories. 

The protocol defines four evaluation channels. **No generalization (** `None` **)** exactly restores a matched anchor episode and serves as the baseline. **Equivariance-only generalization (** `Equi.` **)** resamples only equivariance factors while preserving the anchor’s invariant context, testing geometric adaptation. **Invariance-only generalization (** `Inv.` **)** resamples only invariance factors while preserving the anchor’s task geometry, testing robustness to nuisance variation. **Combined generalization (** `Full` **)** independently resamples both groups without an anchor, testing whether a policy can simultaneously ignore contextual shifts and adapt to new task geometry. 

For each episode _𝑒_ , Bench2Dex samples a generalization configuration **g** _𝑒_ and instantiates the executable scene as 



where T denotes the task specification and **g** _𝑒_ stores the resolved parameters for scene background, tabletop texture, lighting conditions, distractor objects, object pose, table height, and camera pose. The resolved configuration is saved with the episode metadata, making every channel replayable and auditable. Appendix G specifies the sampling ranges and channel composition. 

## **4 Experiments** 

### **4.1 Experimental Setup** 

We evaluate ACT, an image-conditioned 1D U-Net Diffusion Policy variant (DP), _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5, and GR00T N1.5 on all 26 Bench2Dex task–embodiment settings spanning 12 embodiments (Appendix A). Each policy is evaluated with 50 rollouts under four generalization channels, yielding 26 × 4 × 4 × 50 = 20 _,_ 800 evaluation episodes. Evaluation uses deterministic task-partitioned episode seeds and a task-specific horizon set to 1 _._ 5× the recorded expert horizon. Channel semantics follow Section 3.6: `None` , `Equi.` , and `Inv.` are aligned by episode index to matched anchors, whereas `Full` is sampled independently without an anchor. Cross-channel comparisons below therefore use marginal success counts and do not assume a per-instance difficulty ordering. 

The primary outcome is reach-and-stop stable success (Section 3.5), and each table entry is a success count out of 50 rollouts. For a fixed policy and channel, we report the equal-weight task-macro success rate over the 26 settings. Since every setting contributes 50 episodes, this rate is numerically identical to the pooled success rate over 1,300 episodes. The **SR** column is the equal-weight mean of the four channel-specific success rates and introduces no additional evaluation samples. 

### **4.2 Main Results** 

Under the matched `None` condition, GR00T achieves 631 successes among 1,300 rollouts (48.5%), followed by ACT with 383 (29.5%), _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 with 355 (27.3%), and DP with 168 (12.9%). GR00T is the strict observed task-level leader on 23 of the 26 settings, while _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 leads on two and ACT ties GR00T on the remaining setting. Its matched-condition advantage is therefore broad across the evaluated tasks. 

The ordering becomes less concentrated under the combined `Full` shift. GR00T and _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 are nearly tied in aggregate success, with 258 (19.8%) and 256 (19.7%) successes, respectively, followed by ACT with 169 (13.0%) and DP with 50 (3.8%). Despite GR00T’s two-success (0.2 percentage-point) aggregate advantage, _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 has the largest number of strict observed task-level leads: 12, compared with eight for GR00T and two for ACT, with four ties. Aggregate success and the distribution of task-level leaders therefore provide complementary views of performance under the combined shift. Averaged equally over the four channels, GR00T attains 28.3% success, followed by _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 at 20.3%, ACT at 18.0%, and DP at 7.1%.

The LSCR results sharpen this comparison. GR00T has the highest all-task mean LSCR at 47.3%, followed by _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 at 36.1%, ACT at 33.5%, and DP at 23.0%, preserving their ordering by mean SR. Relative to their mean SRs, these LSCR values are higher by 19.0, 15.8, 15.5, and 15.9 percentage points, respectively. These gaps show that LSCR records dependency-valid stage-level progress not represented by binary stable success. This distinction is visible near the SR floor: on Jigsaw Puzzle Assembly, DP and _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 both have 0.0% mean SR but nonzero LSCR (6.3% and 7.4%), while GR00T reaches 30.3% LSCR with 5.0% mean SR. LSCR therefore distinguishes observed dependency-valid stage progress among policy–task cases that binary SR places at or near the floor. 

### **4.3 Generalization Patterns** 

In the observed policy aggregates, `None` yields the highest SR for all four policies: 29.5% for ACT, 12.9% for DP, 27.3% for _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5, and 48.5% for GR00T. Under `Full` , the corresponding rates are 13.0%, 3.8%, 19.7%, and 19.8%. These are descriptive marginal differences between the sampled `None` and `Full` distributions. 

These values summarize marginal performance under the sampled channel distributions rather than a guaranteed difficulty ordering. `None` restores a matched scene, each isolated channel varies one factor group while retaining the other from its anchor, and `Full` independently varies both groups. Because perturbation realizations vary in magnitude and composition, a `Full` episode is not paired with an episode from either isolated channel, nor can it be assumed to be harder on a per-instance basis. Channel differences therefore characterize empirical sensitivity to the sampled distributions; they do not establish per-instance monotonicity, additive penalties, or interactions between the two factor groups. 

The realized four-channel ordering is policy dependent. For ACT and DP, aggregate SR decreases from `None` through `Equi.` and `Inv.` to `Full` . For _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 and GR00T, `None` remains highest and `Inv.` is second, but `Full` exceeds `Equi.` . Thus, combined randomization does not force `Full` to be the lowest empirical aggregate, and relative sensitivity to the isolated shifts is policy dependent in the realized evaluation. 

Using `None` as the matched-scene reference, the observed marginal Full-to-None success-rate ratios are 44.1% for ACT, 29.8% for DP, 72.1% for _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5, and 40.9% for GR00T. GR00T has the highest absolute success under both `None` and `Full` , whereas _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 has the largest ratio. Although a lower `Full` count is not enforced 

9 

by the sampling design, it occurs in 89 of the 104 task–policy comparisons; the remaining 15 are tied in this realized sample. Broken down by policy, `Full` is lower on 25 and equal on one ACT setting, lower on 20 and equal on six DP settings, lower on 18 and equal on eight _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 settings, and lower on all 26 GR00T settings. 

The isolated axes reveal policy-dependent sensitivity. ACT and DP have higher aggregate success under `Equi.` than under `Inv.` (15.4% versus 14.0%, and 6.3% versus 5.2%), whereas _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 and GR00T show the reverse ordering (13.2% versus 21.0%, and 18.8% versus 26.0%). The numbers of settings on which `Inv.` is higher than, equal to, or lower than `Equi.` are 6/9/11 for ACT, 7/10/9 for DP, 18/5/3 for _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5, and 16/3/7 for GR00T. Separating the two axes therefore exposes differences that would be obscured by a single aggregate robustness score. 

### **4.4 Task-Level Heterogeneity** 

`Full` -condition outcomes separate the 26 settings into 12 on which all four policies record nonzero success, three on which every policy records zero success, and 11 with mixed policy outcomes. Microwave Bowl Loading has the largest across-policy `Full` total, with (29 _,_ 4 _,_ 21 _,_ 33) successes for ACT, DP, _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5, and GR00T, respectively. In contrast, Jigsaw Puzzle Assembly, Fridge Fruit Shelf Sorting, and Soup Serving yield zero `Full` successes for every policy. The mixed group exposes policy-specific strengths: ACT leads Citrus Plate Loading with 26 successes, _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 leads Tool Box Loading with 23, and GR00T leads Gaming Desk Setup with 27. On the two non-jigsaw IIWA7+Sharpa settings, only _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 records nonzero `Full` -condition success. These contrasts show that aggregate robustness reflects heterogeneous task–policy outcomes, not a uniform ordering. 

These results characterize stable success for the evaluated settings. The 50 rollouts per cell are evaluation episodes rather than independent retraining replicates, so the table does not estimate between-training variability. Since tasks and embodiments are not factorially crossed, task-level contrasts do not isolate embodiment effects. Stable SR alone does not distinguish partial progress, safety, or execution time. 

## **5 Conclusion** 

We introduced **Bench2Dex** , a simulation benchmark for bimanual dexterous manipulation spanning 12 robot embodiments, 26 long-horizon tasks, and approximately 1.3K human-teleoperated demonstrations. Bench2Dex combines teleoperation, synchronized multimodal data acquisition, a shared contact-geometry-based tactile interface, and executable evaluation of task completion and stage-level progress. Evaluations of ACT, Diffusion Policy, _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5, and GR00T N1.5 using RGB and proprioceptive observations show lower aggregate success under combined scene perturbations than under matched scenes, with outcomes varying across tasks and policies. These results provide reference points for the evaluated training and execution configurations. By bringing data collection and evaluation into a common framework, Bench2Dex provides reusable components for studying bimanual dexterous manipulation and extending evaluation to tactile-conditioned policies and transfer across dexterous hands. 

**Limitation and Outlook.** Dexterous-hand and tactile-sensor designs continue to evolve, and the hand and tactile models in Bench2Dex have not been calibrated against matching physical hardware. Bench2Dex focuses on a shared simulation interface for studying visuo-tactile manipulation across diverse dexterous hands, rather than reproducing a specific physical hand–sensor system. It provides a common setting for algorithm development under explicit modeling and sensing assumptions. As hardware and simulation models advance, future extensions could incorporate refined hand and tactile models, hardware-specific calibration, and physical validation to assess which findings carry over to real-world manipulation.

## **C Unified Tactile Surface Reconstruction** 

Bench2Dex reconstructs tactile contact surfaces for the twelve bimanual hand embodiments included in the benchmark. The representation builds on image-based tactile simulation [27, 28] and the geometry-consistent penetration-depth formulation of TacMap [85], while extending the surface-map abstraction to heterogeneous hand morphologies. For each hand, we identify the physical regions that should generate tactile evidence— elastomer pads, rubber pads, fingertip shells, force-sensor covers, or dedicated touch links—and rebuild or clean them in Blender. The cleaned meshes are then converted into surface point-and-normal assets so 

23 

that the tactile signal is defined on the intended contact surface rather than on arbitrary full-link geometry. The reconstruction follows a common convention across embodiments. Each surface mesh is expressed in the tactile sensor attach-link frame, or converted from the original URDF visual or collision geometry using the corresponding geometry origin, rotation, and mesh scale. The mesh is rasterized into a regular surface-aligned tactile grid, producing point and inward-facing normal maps at the native resolution used by the tactile registry, so that runtime rays are cast from the nominal contact surface toward the finger interior. The generated points are stored in millimeters and converted back to meters during sensing, keeping offline asset generation and runtime ray-casting consistent. 

Different hands expose different mesh sharing patterns: some use a shared non-thumb surface for all non-thumb fingers, while others require independent assets per finger because the pad geometry varies. Table S3 summarizes the resulting grouping policy. The current 12-hand setup uses a four-finger-shared grouping for nine hands and a per-finger independent grouping for three hands. Each hand places one tactile site on every finger, so the ten five-finger embodiments carry ten sites each, while the four-finger Allegro and LEAP embodiments carry eight; palm sites are excluded. In the released data, each site is sampled at the native surface-map resolution of 240 × 240 (subsampling step 1) and captured once per simulation step during replay. 

**Table S3.** Tactile surface-map grouping policy for the twelve Bench2Dex hands. “4F” denotes a shared non-thumb surface group. 

|Grouping policy|Hands|Surface-map asset groups|
|---|---|---|
|Legacy side-shared<br>thumb/4F|Sharpa|Two assets are shared across both hands: TH for<br>thumbs and 4F for all non-thumb fingers. This<br>preserves the original Sharpa TacMap asset<br>convention.|

The non-thumb group uses one<br>representative surface per side. Allegro and LEAP<br>are four-finger hands, so 4F covers index, middle,<br>and ring.|
|Per-finger independent|RH56DFX, Ability, Revo2|Each finger has its own surface-map group on each<br>side, such as RTH, RIDX, RMID, RRING, RLIT<br>and the corresponding left-hand groups. This is<br>used when non-thumb pad meshes are not safely<br>interchangeable.|

### **C.1 Signal Semantics and Depth Quantization** 

The raw value before quantization is the ray-cast distance along the inward-facing local surface normal: each ray is launched from a nominal surface point toward the finger interior, so the first-hit distance measures the depth to which an object surface has penetrated past the nominal contact surface, rather than the gap to an approaching but non-contacting object. Let _𝑑𝑠,𝑡_ ( _𝑢, 𝑣_ ) denote this metric distance, in meters, at tactile pixel ( _𝑢, 𝑣_ ) for site _𝑠_ and frame _𝑡_ . The contact-consistency check is a two-pass test: after the first hit, the ray origin is advanced to just short of the hit point and a reverse ray is cast; the sample is kept only when the reverse ray also intersects the target mesh, which holds once the object surface has crossed the ray’s nominal surface origin. Rays are cast against the meshes of the dynamic task objects and, for articulated task objects, against their mesh-bearing rigid links, within a maximum cast range of 15 mm; static scene geometry such as the tabletop is not among the raycast targets and produces no tactile response. Missed rays (no target hit within this range) and samples that fail the check are assigned zero distance and are additionally recorded by a binary contact-validity mask. For valid samples, the distance is first converted to millimeters, 



and then mapped to an 8-bit integer through the piecewise quantizer used by the released TacMap implementation [85], 



followed by clipping and casting, 



The quantized map is then spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel evaluated in floating point. The filtered response is rounded and cast back to an 8-bit integer before being stored in the tactile stream,

where G _𝜎_ denotes Gaussian filtering and the current implementation uses _𝜎_ = 1 _._ 5; the kernel size is max(1 _,_ ⌊9/step⌋) rounded up to an odd integer, which gives 9 × 9 at the released subsampling step of 1. The first branch allocates finer precision to small contact depths, using 0 _._ 005 mm per integer level for _𝑧<_ 0 _._ 5 mm, while the second branch uses a coarser 0 _._ 03 mm per level for larger geometric penetration-depth values. Values of 5 _._ 15 mm and above saturate at 255. Thus, each tactile-map pixel preserves high sensitivity near initial contact while remaining compact as a single 8-bit value in the HDF5 tactile stream. 

## **D HDF5 Schema Details** 

**Table S8.** Full per-episode HDF5 organization used by Bench2Dex when all eight modalities are collected. _𝑇_ denotes the number of recorded frames, _𝐽_ the robot joint dimension, _𝐻_ × _𝑊_ the camera resolution, and _𝐻𝑡_ × _𝑊𝑡_ the surface-aligned tactile resolution (240 × 240 in the released data).

Episode-level quantities are first summarized within each cell, and benchmark-level episode metrics are equal-weight means across tasks. For metrics defined as means over all _𝑁_ episodes, this task-macro mean equals the corresponding pooled episode mean because every reported cell contains 50 episodes. Unless noted otherwise, the benchmark uses the reach-and-stop protocol; fixed-horizon evaluation is treated as a distinct protocol and identified explicitly in the evaluation summary. 

### **E.1 Primary Metrics** 

**Metric set.** The core reported metric set is 



SR is the primary completion outcome; LSCR and SafeSR provide complementary views of progress and safety, while the remaining quantities characterize success-conditional efficiency, violations, and robustness. SR can be accompanied by a central 95% confidence interval computed from 10,000 percentile-bootstrap resamples of the corresponding episode group with a fixed seed of 0. 

**Reach-and-stop success.** In the reported evaluations, the evaluator is updated once per executed physics step. Let _𝐶𝑒, 𝑗_ ∈{0 _,_ 1} be the terminal predicate at evaluator update _𝑗_ , _𝛿𝑡𝑒, 𝑗_ the elapsed simulation time since the preceding update, _𝑛𝑒_ the number of executed updates, and Δ _𝑒_ the configured dwell time. The accumulated dwell time is 



= Define _𝑗𝑒_<sup>stable</sup> = min{ _𝑗_ ≤ _𝑛𝑒_ : _ℎ𝑒, 𝑗_ ≥ Δ _𝑒_ } when this set is nonempty, _𝑆𝑒_ = **1** [ _𝑗𝑒_<sup>stable</sup> exists], and _𝑡𝑒_<sup>stable</sup> _𝑒_ � _𝑟𝑗_ =<sup>stable</sup> 1<sup>_𝛿𝑡𝑒,𝑟_.The default dwell time is 0</sup><sup>_._5 s.Under reach-and-stop, an episode terminates at stable success;</sup> otherwise it ends at the evaluation horizon or when evaluation cannot proceed. A recorded episode that terminates because of a policy or runtime evaluation error remains in the denominator and is counted as unsuccessful. The stable success rate is 



This protocol avoids counting transient contacts or unstable placements as successful episodes. 

**Latched stage progress.** Binary success is insufficient for long-horizon manipulation because a policy may complete early stages but fail later. Each task specifies a set of stages G _𝑒_ = { _𝑔𝑒,𝑘_ }<sup>_𝐾_</sup> _𝑘_ =<sup>_𝑒_</sup> 1<sup>with optional dependency</sup> edges. Let _𝐿𝑒,𝑘_ be one if the predicate of stage _𝑘_ is true at some update _𝑗_ ≤ _𝑛𝑒_ and all dependencies were latched earlier or become valid in the same-step fixed-point closure over the task’s acyclic dependency graph; otherwise let it be zero. Once set, _𝐿𝑒,𝑘_ remains one. The primary progress metric is 



The benchmark defines aggregate LSCR as the mean of LSCR _𝑒_ over all evaluated episodes. It measures ever-reached, dependency-valid milestones rather than final-state satisfaction; terminal-state stage status is retained as a diagnostic below. 

30 

**Completion time.** Completion time is reported as the success-conditional mean 



when at least one episode succeeds; otherwise it is undefined. Because this quantity conditions on success, it should be interpreted together with SR and the number of successful episodes. Expert-normalized speed and step-based execution counts are auxiliary diagnostics rather than primary ranking fields. 

**Safety.** Safety is evaluated over executed physics steps. Let _𝐷𝑒_ and _𝐻𝑒_ denote whether episode _𝑒_ contains a task-defined drop or tracked-object high-speed violation, respectively. The hard-violation indicator is _𝐵𝑒_ = _𝐷𝑒_ ∨ _𝐻𝑒_ by default; a joint-limit rule is included only when the task explicitly promotes it to the core safety criterion. The safe-success indicator is _𝑆𝑒_ (1 − _𝐵𝑒_ ). Accordingly, 



The associated rates are DropR = _𝑁_<sup>−1 �</sup> _𝑒_<sup>_𝐷_</sup> _𝑒_<sup>andHSR=</sup><sup>_𝑁_−1 �</sup> _𝑒_<sup>_𝐻_</sup> _𝑒_<sup>.Theseeventsarenotmutually</sup> exclusive, so their rates need not sum to HVR. If _𝑉𝑒, 𝑗_ indicates any task-level violation at executed step _𝑗_ , the pooled violation-step rate is 



This is an exposure-normalized rate over executed steps and is interpreted together with episode-level HVR. High-speed events are severe-motion proxies, not contact-force or collision measurements. Joint-limit observations are treated as auxiliary diagnostics unless a task explicitly defines them as safety violations. 

**Robustness.** For generalized evaluation, let P comprise the None, Equi., Inv., and Full evaluation channels. The benchmark provides each channel’s SR, confidence interval, and sample count. For a shifted channel _𝑝_ ∈P \ {None}, the relative ratio is 



when SRNone _>_ 0. Let P+ = P \ {None} and _𝑁 𝑝_ be the number of episodes in channel _𝑝_ . The aggregate used by the benchmark is 



RR is reported together with the absolute channel-wise SRs as a supporting robustness descriptor. These are grouped, unpaired comparisons rather than paired causal estimates. 

### **E.2 Diagnostic Metrics** 

Diagnostic metrics are not used as primary ranking fields. They expose failure modes and execution characteristics that are not uniformly applicable or comparable across all tasks and embodiments. A quantity that is undefined for a task is marked as unavailable rather than assigned a value of zero. 

31 

**Completion diagnostics.** Let _𝐼𝑒_ = max _𝑗_ ≤ _𝑛𝑒 𝐶𝑒, 𝑗_ indicate whether the terminal predicate is satisfied at least once, without imposing the dwell-time requirement, and let _𝐹𝑒_ = _𝐶𝑒,𝑛𝑒_ indicate whether it is satisfied at the rollout’s actual termination observation. The corresponding ever-instantaneous and terminal-state success rates are 



For stage-level diagnosis, let _𝐴𝑒,𝑘_ ( _𝑛𝑒_ ) indicate that the dependencies of stage _𝑘_ have been satisfied by termination. The terminal-state stage completion rate is 



Current and latched dependency-chain depths further distinguish terminal-state progress from progress reached at any earlier point. LSCR remains the primary stage-completion measure. 

**Efficiency and execution diagnostics.** For a successful episode from task _𝑞_ with a configured expert reference, task efficiency is the benchmark-specific speed ratio 



where _𝐻𝑞_<sup>expert</sup> is the task-level reference step count and _𝛿𝑡𝑞_ is its simulation integration interval. TE is unavailable for failures or tasks without a reference. This ratio is unbounded and is comparable only under matched simulation timing, initial-state distribution, terminal condition, dwell time, and evaluation horizon. Additional execution measures include the numbers of physics steps, policy-rate control steps, and policy queries required to reach stable success; the latter two differ for chunked policies. 

**Safety diagnostics.** Safety diagnostics include violation-event density, per-type violation counts, hard joint-limit observations, finger-joint saturation, active-step rates, and maximum observed joint-limit excess. These quantities characterize kinematic constraint violations and control behavior, and they remain separate from the primary task-safety definition unless included in a task’s safety criterion. 

**Grasp diagnostics.** For contact-rich tasks, Bench2Dex defines a kinematic grasp stability index (GSI). Since reliable hand–object contact geometry and hand forward kinematics are not uniformly available for every supported embodiment, GSI is a proxy based on object lift, stable holding, object motion, hold duration, and slip events. For a configured tracked object _𝑜_ ∈O _𝑒_<sup>grasp</sup> at step _𝑗_ , the canonical score is 



where all components lie in [0 _,_ 1]. Specifically, _𝐿_ indicates lift relative to the initial object height; _𝐻_ takes values 1, 0 _._ 35, 0 _._ 15, or 0 for held, lifted-and-stable, lifted-only, or other states; _𝑀_ = exp[−<sup><u>1</u></sup> 2<sup>(∥</sup><sup>_𝑣_∥/</sup><sup>_𝜎𝑣_+ ∥</sup><sup>_𝜔_∥/</sup><sup>_𝜎𝜔_)];</sup> _𝑄_ = 0 _._ 75 + 0 _._ 25 min(1 _, 𝑑_ / _𝑑_ min) when held and 1 otherwise; and _𝐴_ = 1 − min(1 _, 𝑠_ / _𝑠_ max). The thresholds and scales follow the task configuration or benchmark defaults. The episode-level grasp diagnostics are 





The former records peak grasp quality, whereas the latter summarizes positive-score object–step observations. 

32 

**Tool-use and motion diagnostics.** Tool-use diagnostics are enabled only when stages specify tool IDs or tool equivalence classes. For episode _𝑒_ , tool selection accuracy measures whether the first held object selected for an eligible stage belongs to its allowed tool set: 



An annotated stage with no selected tool is counted as incorrect. Tool switch success rate measures whether an attempted switch releases the previous tool stably and grasps the next tool stably before timeout: 



TSSR is unavailable for episodes without a switch attempt. Aggregate TSA and TSSR are means over episodes for which the corresponding quantity is defined, and TSSR is accompanied by total attempted and successful switch counts. Robot-motion diagnostics summarize joint velocity, acceleration, jerk, and effort by first computing the root mean square over available steps and joints within each episode and then averaging episode values. They are interpreted only under a shared embodiment and timing configuration. Execution summaries additionally provide the mean rollout length and the number of episodes that terminate because evaluation cannot proceed. 

### **E.3 Reproducibility Metadata** 

Each evaluation summary is accompanied by the protocol required to interpret and reproduce its scores: policy identity, base seed and seed-derivation rule, number of episodes, evaluation-failure count, termination rule, maximum evaluation horizon, and dwell time. For randomized evaluation, the resolved episode seed and sampled generalization parameters are retained for each rollout. Together, these quantities support reproducible audit and reconstruction under a matched simulator, backend, task, and perturbation configuration. 

## **F Policy Training Configurations** 

This section discloses the training configurations of the four policies evaluated in Table 2: ACT, DP, _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5, and GR00T N1.5. ACT and DP are trained from scratch on Bench2Dex demonstrations; _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 and GR00T N1.5 are fine-tuned from their respective public checkpoints. For _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 and GR00T N1.5, whose pretrained action heads assume lower-dimensional action spaces than the bimanual-dexterous embodiments require, we retain the pretrained weights and randomly initialize the additional output dimensions to match the target action space. Unless stated otherwise, each policy is trained on a single task–embodiment setting and consumes the synchronized multi-view RGB and proprioceptive observations recorded in the unified HDF5 episodes. The default hyperparameters reported below are those of the released training launchers ( `policy/<name>/train.sh` ); per-task overrides, when applied, are logged with the corresponding checkpoint. 

**ACT.** We train ACT from scratch using its conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) formulation. The encoder and decoder are Transformer networks with a hidden dimension of 512 and a feed-forward dimension of 3 _,_ 200. Inputs are four camera views (both wrist and both stereo cameras) encoded by a shared ResNet-18 backbone together with the normalized proprioceptive state, whose dimension is sized to each embodiment’s active degrees of freedom. The policy predicts an action chunk of length _𝑇_ pred = 30 from a single observation ( _𝑇𝑜_ = 1) and is supervised with an _ℓ_ 1 reconstruction loss regularized by a KL term of weight 10. We optimize with AdamW at a learning rate of 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup> and a batch size of 32 for up to 6 _,_ 000 epochs on a single RTX 4090 GPU. At inference the policy re-plans at every step and fuses overlapping chunk predictions by temporal ensembling. 

33 

**Diffusion Policy (DP).** We train DP from scratch using the image-conditioned 1D U-Net variant of Diffusion Policy. Multi-view RGB observations are resized to 216 × 288 and encoded independently by ResNet-18 visual backbones, whose features are fused into the global conditioning vector of the denoiser. The denoiser is a 1D conditional U-Net with feature widths (256 _,_ 512 _,_ 1024), a 128-dimensional diffusion-step embedding, and kernel size 5. At each control cycle the policy conditions on the most recent _𝑇𝑜_ = 3 observations, denoises a _𝑇_ pred = 8-step action trajectory, and executes the first _𝑇_ exec = 6 actions before re-planning from fresh observations, yielding receding-horizon closed-loop control. Training adopts the DDPM ( _𝜖_ -prediction) objective over 100 diffusion timesteps under a squared-cosine noise schedule, and 100 denoising steps are taken at inference. We optimize with AdamW at a peak learning rate of 1 × 10<sup>−4</sup> , a global batch size of 512, 500-step linear warmup followed by cosine decay, and an EMA of the policy weights with decay 0 _._ 9999. Each task-specific policy is trained for up to 300 epochs on eight H100 GPUs. 

_𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 **.** We fully fine-tune the pretrained _𝜋_ 0 _._ 5 vision–language–action model using the openpi implementation, initializing from the public `pi05 base` checkpoint. The released `pi05` ~~`b`~~ `ase` ~~`d`~~ `ex2bench` ~~`f`~~ `ull` configuration trains the non-LoRA PaliGemma-2B vision–language backbone and Gemma-300M action expert jointly. The state and action dimensions are selected from the active degrees of freedom of each embodiment. Compatible pretrained parameters are retained, while state/action projection layers whose shapes differ from the pretrained checkpoint remain randomly initialized. The policy conditions on four RGB views (both stereo and both wrist cameras), normalized proprioception, and the task instruction. It predicts an action chunk of _𝑇_ pred = 20 steps with a maximum token length of 280; all _𝑇_ exec = 20 actions are executed before the policy re-observes and re-plans. We optimize all trainable parameters with AdamW using a cosine learning-rate schedule with 100 warmup steps, a peak learning rate of 1 × 10<sup>−4</sup> , and decay to 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> over 2 _,_ 000 steps. The released launcher uses a global batch size of 256, 32 data-loading workers, `fsdp` ~~`d`~~ `evices` = 1, and a total of 2 _,_ 000 training steps. EMA is disabled. 

**GR00T N1.5.** We fine-tune the pretrained GR00T N1.5 generalist policy on the demonstrations of each evaluation task using full-parameter fine-tuning of the backbone, without LoRA adapters. The policy receives four temporally synchronized RGB camera views, the embodiment proprioceptive state, and the task instruction as a per-task language prompt. To accommodate the heterogeneous bimanual-dexterous embodiments, we pad the state vector to a common 64-dimensional representation and extend the pretrained action head from its native maximum dimensionality to 64 dimensions; action channels beyond the pretrained head are newly initialized and optimized jointly with the pretrained parameters, while padded action dimensions are masked from the action objective, preserving a single policy interface across embodiments. GR00T N1.5 uses a flow-matching action head that, from a single observation ( _𝑇𝑜_ = 1), predicts a _𝑇_ pred = 16-step action chunk; at inference the chunk is generated with 4 flow-matching denoising steps and executed in full ( _𝑇_ exec = 16) before the policy re-observes and re-plans. We optimize with AdamW at a peak learning rate of 1 × 10<sup>−4</sup> with 5% linear warmup followed by cosine decay and a global batch size of 64, training in bfloat16 mixed precision for 20 _,_ 000 steps on a single H100 GPU. 

## **G Generalization Configuration** 

**Scene background.** Scene background randomization changes the visual surroundings while leaving the tabletop task unchanged. The benchmark includes 60 iTHOR/USD indoor scenes, partitioned into 50 seen and 10 unseen scenes. Each scene has a calibrated yaw and translation offset, and, when this factor is resampled, each episode samples exactly one scene from its designated partition; the nominal background is not substituted. The geometry of the sampled background scene is used only for visual rendering and is excluded from collision and contact simulation. This factor therefore evaluates object grounding under unseen scene backgrounds without introducing room-level physical interactions. 

34 

**Tabletop texture.** Tabletop texture randomization changes the visual material of the support surface while preserving its geometry and contact behavior. The texture collection contains 11,824 materials across carpet, fabric, flooring, leather, metal, rust, stone, and wood, with 9,436 seen and 2,388 unseen materials assigned by a deterministic 80/20 split. When this factor is resampled, each episode receives a sampled texture, preventing a fixed tabletop texture from becoming a localization shortcut. 

**Lighting conditions.** Lighting randomization modifies the lights embedded in the sampled USD room. The distant light samples intensity in [1000 _,_ 1500], each color channel in [0 _._ 4 _,_ 1 _._ 0], pitch in [−30<sup>◦</sup> _,_ −5<sup>◦</sup> ], yaw in [−90<sup>◦</sup> _,_ 90<sup>◦</sup> ], and angular size in [0 _._ 5<sup>◦</sup> _,_ 1 _._ 0<sup>◦</sup> ]. The dome light samples intensity in [150 _,_ 350], color between [0 _._ 8 _,_ 0 _._ 8 _,_ 0 _._ 6] and [1 _,_ 1 _,_ 1], and exposure in [−0 _._ 5 _,_ 0 _._ 5]. These ranges are shared across splits and probe sensitivity to illumination, shadows, contrast, and exposure. 

**Object pose.** Object pose randomization changes task-relevant initial poses within valid bounds. For explicitly positioned objects, _𝑥_ and _𝑦_ are independently perturbed by up to ±2 cm and yaw by up to ±10<sup>◦</sup> . If a sampled pose violates collision or workspace constraints, the perturbation magnitude is progressively reduced; the nominal pose is retained only when no valid perturbed pose is found. Objects without a fixed pose are instead resampled within task-defined zones subject to collision constraints. Task-specific geometric constraints may fix an object’s initial pose or restrict its perturbation range. 

**Camera pose.** Camera pose randomization perturbs external and wrist-mounted camera viewpoints. Worldmounted cameras sample translation and look-at-target offsets of ±5 mm per axis, distance offsets of ±3 cm, and roll–pitch–yaw offsets of ±1<sup>◦</sup> per axis. Wrist cameras sample link-frame translation offsets of ±5 mm per axis and rotation offsets of ±1<sup>◦</sup> per axis. Stereo cameras share one perturbation sample to preserve their relative pose. The seen and unseen camera profiles use the same numerical ranges, so this factor evaluates calibration and viewpoint perturbations rather than a disjoint camera-hardware split. 

**Distractor objects.** Distractor object randomization adds one to three dynamic distractors per episode. The distractor set contains 68 assets, partitioned into 52 seen and 16 unseen assets; each selected object is scaled by a factor in [0 _._ 8 _,_ 1 _._ 2]. Objects that duplicate a task-relevant object or are semantically confusable with one are excluded before sampling. Placement satisfies collision constraints, a 5 cm table-edge margin, and a central exclusion region _𝑥_ ∈[−0 _._ 25 _,_ 0 _._ 25] m and _𝑦_ ∈[−0 _._ 20 _,_ 0 _._ 35] m. This procedure evaluates grounding under occlusion, ambiguity, crowding, and incidental contact without deliberately blocking the primary workspace. 

**Table height.** Table height randomization samples a vertical offset in [−0 _._ 05 _,_ 0 _._ 05] m around each task’s nominal tabletop height (default 0 _._ 75 m). The robot mount remains at its nominal height, while on-table object placement, evaluator height references, and dependent collision checks follow the shifted surface. The resulting change in robot-to-table geometry tests adaptation of reaching, grasping, and contact heights.
