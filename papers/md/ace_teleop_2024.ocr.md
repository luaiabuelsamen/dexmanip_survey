Abstract: Learning from demonstrations has shown to be an effective approach
to robotic manipulation, especially with the recently collected large-scale robot
data with teleoperation systems. Building an efficient teleoperation system across
diverse robot platforms has become more crucial than ever. However, there is a
notable lack of cost-effective and user-friendly teleoperation systems for differ-
ent end-effectors, e.g., anthropomorphic robot hands and grippers, that can op-
erate across multiple platforms. To address this issue, we develop ACE, a cross-
platform visual-exoskeleton system for low-cost dexterous teleoperation. Our sys-
tem utilizes a hand-facing camera to capture 3D hand poses and an exoskeleton
mounted on a portable base, enabling accurate real-time capture of both finger and
wrist poses. Compared to previous systems, which often require hardware cus-
tomization according to different robots, our single system can generalize to hu-
manoid hands, arm-hands, arm-gripper, and quadruped-gripper systems with high-
precision teleoperation. This enables imitation learning for complex manipulation
tasks on diverse platforms. Webpage: https://ace-teleop.github.io/.

Introduction
In recent years, the effectiveness of training robot foundation models using real-world robot data has
led to a significant increase in attention to data collection. Teleoperation has emerged as a crucial
data collection method, enabling researchers to demonstrate and record complex robotic tasks. Vari-
ous solutions, including VR systems [1, 2, 3], motion capture systems [4, 5], wearable gloves [6, 7],
and low-cost devices [8, 9], have been developed to facilitate teleoperation, each offering unique
advantages in terms of accessibility, precision, and generalizability. As we assess these existing
systems, a critical question arises: What key information must be captured to effectively perform
dexterous manipulation tasks on a wide range of robot platforms?
The answer is quite simple: accurate hand poses and end-effector positions, which can be achieved
with low-cost hardware. We propose ACE, a cross-platform visual-exoskeletons system for low-cost
dexterous teleoperation, as illustrated in Figure 1. For hand pose capture, we utilize a low-cost cam-
era combined with a 3D hand pose estimation method [10, 11, 12]. To address the common issue
of occlusion on vision-based systems, our design features a camera mounted on the end effector of
the exoskeleton, ensuring it always follows the front face of the hand. The exoskeletons, which are
3D printed, provide precise end-effector positions through forward kinematics. With this, the robot
hardware does not need to match the morphology of the teleoperation system. During teleoperation,
as the operator moves the exoskeletons and their hands, we capture the hand root end-effector posi-
tion and hand pose in real-time. We then use inverse kinematics to map the robot arm end-effector
with the human hand end-effector position. This allows for effective motion retargeting between
human hands and robot hands, enabling precise control of the robot’s fingers.

We compare our teleoperation system with several recently proposed systems, as shown in Table 1,
to illustrate our advancement. The ALOHA [8, 13] system provides precise control of bimanual
manipulators, primarily focusing on parallel-jaw grippers. By directly matching the joints between
the teleoperation system and the robot, ALOHA can achieve precise control of the end-effector.
However, this advantage limits its usage to only the specific designated hardware. In contrast, our
system allows the operation of multiple robot hardware types and offers the flexibility to control
multi-finger robot hands instead of only parallel-jaw grippers. This flexibility enables data collection
on more diverse tasks. Our system can even be adapted to 2-DOF grippers using simplified hand
gestures. The GELLO [9] system achieves one-to-one joint matching by using a smaller-sized robot
arm to control the actual robot arm. However, we show in our experiments that this mismatch in
size makes it hard to control for fine manipulation tasks. Our system, on the contrary, provides more
precise control by focusing on transferring the motion of only the end-effectors. AnyTeleop [14]
uses cameras to capture hand poses and perform teleoperation directly with the camera data. While
this method pushes the boundary of low cost and simplicity in teleoperation hardware, the vision-
based system can only provide limited accuracy in measuring the hand root end-effector poses.
Our system, which employs an exoskeleton for capturing hand poses, provides a more accurate and
reliable measurement of the hand root end-effector.
Our system leverages the precision of kinematics-based exoskeletons, combined with the afford-
ability and adaptability of vision-based systems. Acting as a bridge between these two approaches,
we can obtain accurate hand poses and end-effector positions at a low cost while ensuring cross-
platform compatibility. In this paper, we introduce our teleoperation system, including the hardware
design and the software modules that enable cross-platform operations. Our experiments show two
key advantages. First, our designed system enables users to quickly adapt and efficiently, accurately,

and swiftly complete tasks under various precision and workspace requirements. Second, our im-
itation learning experiments demonstrated that our system can efficiently collect effective data and
complete the corresponding imitation learning.

Related Work
Learning from human demonstrations. Learning from human demonstrations has emerged as a
widely adopted approach in robotic manipulation, leveraging the ability to replicate complex tasks
by observing human actions. In-the-wild data from human hand movements offers a rich and ac-
cessible source of demonstration data for robot learning [2, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Recent studies have
shown that utilizing teleoperation for robot control and data collection is both efficient and transfer-
able [13, 14, 9, 21, 22]. However, collecting large-scale datasets in real-world environments is often
time-consuming and resource-intensive [23, 24, 25, 26]. To enhance efficiency and expedite data
collection, it is crucial to develop systems that are generalizable to a wide range of robot platforms,
end-effectors, and tasks.
Vision-based Teleoperation. Teleoperation for manipulation has a long history [27], with common
solutions like VR [2, 1, 28, 29, 30, 31], motion capture devices [4, 5], and gloves [6, 7], smart-
phones [32, 33], and other devices [34, 35]. Those systems provide accurate tracking poses for ma-
nipulation tasks. However, high-cost devices are less accessible, which limits large-scale data collec-
tion. In contrast, vision-based teleoperation is particularly adaptable and user-friendly [36, 37, 38],
which requires less hardware setup, can be adapted to different body types, and is relatively low-
cost without complex hardware setups. Effective hand-tracking algorithms [10, 11, 12] allow for
the transfer of human hand motions to anthropomorphic robot hands [39, 14, 40, 38]. Direct wrist
tracking and motion transfer allow for cross-platform operations on a wider range of robot plat-
forms [3, 18, 39, 41, 42]. However, vision-based tracking systems are sensitive to occlusion, which
introduces ambiguities in the hand poses. Wrist pose estimation in the world coordinate can also be
inaccurate and noisy.
Kinematics-based Data Collection. Data collection directly from the robot itself has also been
employed [43]. Recent works of developing a replica of a robot have shown high efficiency for data
collection [44] and teleoperation [8, 9]. These systems mirror the target robot’s kinematic structure,
enabling accurate movement and interaction replication. The controlling process is straightforward
with joint-matching [13, 9, 45]. Exoskeletons are also intuitive solutions for human operators, but
normally with a significantly higher cost [46, 47, 48, 49] and do not support hand modeling. Our
work is also related to recently proposed DexCap [15] (Table 1) which utilizes a hand motion capture
system with a mobile base, with more expensive hardware. Its wrist tracking is based on real-time
localization, which is more accurate than pure vision methods but introduces delay. Compared to
DexCap, our system allows cross-platform generalization with enhanced accuracy and flexibility
using a low-cost design.

System Design
To develop a cross-platform and low-cost dexterous teleoperation system that enables efficient
large-scale data collection, we summarize the desiderata into the following five principles: Cross-
platform Compatibility: Ensuring versatility across various robot platforms, such as fixed-based
robot arms, quadrupeds, and humanoids, while accommodating different end-effector types, includ-
ing anthropomorphic hands and parallel-jaw grippers. Accuracy: Transferring the precise hand and
wrist pose of the operator to actual robot platforms. This enables fine-grained manipulation tasks
and improves the success rate of data collection. Low-cost: Emphasizing affordability to facili-
tate easy prototyping and lower the barrier to large-scale data collection. This encourages the use
of readily available, off-the-shelf components and materials, instead of expensive components like
VR headsets or motion tracking systems. User-friendly: Ensuring the system is intuitive to use,
requiring minimal expertise for calibration and operation, and accommodating users of different
heights and weights. We also aim for two types of bases - fixed or mobile - so the user can eas-
ily switch between fixed and mobile tasks. Easy to Manufacture and Maintain: Designing the

system to be straightforward to manufacture and maintain, with easily replaceable components to
minimize downtime and extend operational lifespan. This includes a modular design using standard
components to support easy assembly, disassembly, and replacement.
An overview of our ACE system design is illustrated in Fig. 2. Our system consists of a 3D-printed
bimanual exoskeleton and two hand-facing low-cost webcams mounted at the ends of the exoskele-
ton. The exoskeleton’s joint position tracking provides accurate wrist pose by forward kinematics,
and the two cameras provide precise hand-pose tracking. By combining these two sources of infor-
mation, the system enables real-time hand pose tracking relative to the world coordinate.
After obtaining the accurate hand pose, we map it to target robot poses on various robot platforms.
After the control mapping, we can teleoperate robots and collect demonstrations for imitation learn-
ing. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our teleoperation system on a range of
robots with various end-effectors, including the Xarm with Ability Hand, H1 with Inspire Hand, B1
with Z1, Franka with a gripper, and GR-1 with a gripper.
3.1
Hardware Design
Dual-base setup. The proposed ACE system, shown in Fig. 3, has two arms and two types of bases:
desktop and mobile. This dual-base setup provides cross-platform compatibility from mobile robots
to robot arms. The desktop version provides a stable and precise wrist pose from its stationary
base. For long-term teleoperation, the user may rest their elbows on the platform. The mobile base
is designed for tasks that need constant movement or continuous adjustment of the field of view.
Specifically suitable for mobile platforms including humanoids and quadrupeds.
Servos and cameras. Our system features two arms, each with seven links, six degrees of freedom
(DoF), a wrist, and a camera mount. Each arm is equipped with a UCB2Dynamixel (U2D2) con-
troller and DYNAMIXEL XL330-M288-T servos with high-resolution 12-bit encoders for accurate
joint position readings, ensuring precise end-effector tracking. The two-DoF camera mount allows
for optimal hand positioning to avoid occlusion issues common in vision-based hand tracking.

Magnetic connections. We utilize a modular design with magnetic connections, as illustrated in
Fig. 3. The use of magnets is not only inexpensive but also significantly enhances the user experi-
ence. Traditionally, donning exoskeleton equipment can be a complex process. However, our mag-
netically modular design allows users to independently don the system (the desktop version) in less
than 30 seconds. Additionally, the magnetic connections facilitate quick and easy size adjustments.
The wrist size can be altered almost instantly, and the upper and lower arm length adjustments can be
completed in under 2 minutes. This modular design allows easy integration of updated components,
enabling efficient upgrades to our open-source system.
3.2
Pose Estimation and End-Effector Control Mapping
When the user starts collecting demonstrations, we estimate the precise wrist pose and hand key-
points. The wrist pose is determined by reading joint angles from the exoskeleton’s encoders and
calculating the pose using the forward kinematics of the designed exoskeletons [50]. Hand images
are processed using MediaPipe [11], a lightweight, RGB-based hand detection tool that can operate
in real-time on a CPU, to detect the 21 hand keypoints in the wrist frame.
After obtaining the wrist and hand pose data, we map human movements to target robot poses
and end-effector control signals across various platforms. To meet the specific needs of different
platforms and tasks, we address three significant challenges in developing the control interface:
workspace mismatch, control scale variability, and usability concerns.
Matching workspace sizes. First, the variation in workspace sizes poses a significant challenge on
different platforms, particularly in achieving full coverage during bimanual operations. For a given
platform, users can specify the required workspace in the configuration. By wearing our device and
moving their arms around, we align the center of the human and robot workspaces and document
the matching scale between these two workspaces.
Control scale variability. Second, different tasks and platforms require varying levels of con-
trol precision. For example, when using a scaled replica of the actual robot platform, direct joint-
matching teleoperations will result in errors being amplified when transferring the motion to a larger
robot arm [9]. Moving the small teleoperation end-effector by a small distance may translate to
much larger movement on the actual robot arm, significantly impacting control accuracy for fine
tasks. Instead, in our system, by using inverse kinematics to map the end-effector positions, we can
provide a more accurate and intuitive mapping from the teleoperation device to the actual robot.
Consider the 6D robot end-effector pose xe ∈R6, and the human wrist pose xh ∈R6, we map xh
to xe as
xe = γ(xh −ch) + ct
(1)
where γ is the control scale, ch is the center of the human workspace, and ct is the center of the
task workspace. More detailed parameter definitions are included in the Appendix A. We show that
in our experiments, this scaled approach is more efficient and adaptable to different workspaces and
task sizes than direct joint matching methods.

Figure 4: Details of Cross-Platform Teleoperation. This figure showcases various control modes
for efficiently teleoperating different robots, including normal/mirror modes and hands/gripper con-
figurations. Additionally, it illustrates the application of our Dual-base setup in various scenarios. In
the Dual-Arm+Hands setup, normal mode with a desktop base is used to control the xArm with the
ability hand. The Humanoid+Hands setup employs mirror mode with a desktop base to control the
robot. In the Quadrapeds+Gripper setup, the right hand controls the robot in normal mode, while
the left hand uses simple poses to manage the quadruped’s movement using a pre-trained low-level
control policy at a fixed velocity. The mobile base allows the operator to follow the robot’s move-
ments, enabling better control.
Usability. The biggest challenge for cross-platform teleoperation is usability. Cross-platform de-
ployment often involves redundant and labor-intensive calibration processes when switching plat-
forms. To enhance usability and accommodate different tasks and robot platforms, we have different
control modes as an additional layer before transferring the end-effector pose to the actual robot:
• Normal Mode: Direct transfer end-effector positions to the actual robot. The end-effector pose in
this mode xnormal
e
is the same as in Eq. (1), where γ is the ratio between the robot and human
workspace radius.
• Mirror Mode: Designed for large robots, this mode allows users to operate face-to-face with the
robot. In this mode xmirror
e
= −γmirror
e
(xh−ch)+ct where the end-effector motion is mirrored,
thus making it more intuitive during operation.
• Bimanual Mode: For bimanual tasks that require high precision, the cameras may collide. We
adjust the scaling factor γ and ct so that the left and right hand side workspaces align. In this
setting, when the camera mounts are about to collide, the robot hands touch each other.
Based on different types of end-effectors, we also support:
• Gripper Mode: Tailored for parallel jaw grippers, this mode provides straightforward control for
tasks suited to this end-effector type. The distance between the thumb tip and the index fingertip
is linearly mapped to a range of 0 to 1.
• Hand Mode: The hand and fingertip motions are retargeted to the robot hand; detailed principles
are provided in the Appendix B.

Figure 6: End Effector Accuracy Evaluation. By extending the tape from 20 cm to 40 cm, the
teleoperation end-effector demonstrates precise replication of the operator’s motion with an average
error of only 3 mm.
After mapping the wrist poses to the robot’s coordinate frame, the joint angles of the robot arm can
be obtained using inverse kinematics (IK). Different robot platforms may require specific filters, PID
parameters, and constraints to ensure safety, smooth movements, and reduce issues from singularity.
The robot hand joints are obtained from human hand poses and mapped through hand motion re-
targeting [14]. Our system is designed for easy calibration, incorporating servos with absolute zero
position feedback for one-time calibration without disassembly. The zero position aligns the arm
perfectly when placed flat on a table, and the same arm design is used for both mobile and desk-
top versions, eliminating the need for recalibration when switching bases. We have optimized the
computational efficiency to ensure a hand pose tracking frequency of approximately 27 Hz, which
can be further improved to 100 Hz with a higher-frequency camera. Integration with the gRPC
pipeline facilitates extension to other platforms such as Vision Pro. These approaches ensure that
our teleoperation system is adaptable, precise, and user-friendly, addressing the primary challenges
of deploying such systems across diverse robotic platforms.

Experiments
We designed experiments to investigate two key aspects of our proposed teleoperation system: pre-
cision and transferability. We designed a target-reaching task to show that our system can achieve
precise end-effector control, compared to previous joint-matching systems. We show how robots
autonomously perform tasks via imitation learning trained using the data collected from our system,
and we show more teleoperation examples in Fig. 5.
4.1
End Effector Accuracy and Efficiency
Precision evaluation. Similar to other joint matching methods [51, 45, 9], the end-effector pose
obtained from the joint encoder is highly accurate. Specifically, in our system, the average forward
kinematics error is around 1 mm. As shown in Fig. 6, we perform teleoperation on a measurement
tape extension task. By extending the tape from 20 cm to 40 cm, we show that the teleoperation
end-effector accurately represents the operator’s motion, with an average error of only 3mm. The
errors presented in this figure are cumulative, including both teleoperation and robot control errors,
yet the overall error remains within a reasonable range.
Target-reaching evaluation. We compare the agility and precision of our ACE system with the
previous joint-matching system, specifically GELLO [9] for its comparable cost and open-sourced
implementation. We designed a target-reaching task to evaluate the performance of both systems in
a simulation. The operator’s objective was to control the end-effectors to reach randomly generated
target regions. Success was recorded when both end-effectors reached their respective target area
and remained within the target regions for a short duration.
We set up four scenarios to assess teleoperation performance, with workspaces and target regions of
small, medium, and large sizes. Our evaluation involved six operators. Further details about the task

of the system by the time used to reach the target region, the average reaching speed, the average

narios and metrics, demonstrating shorter time costs, higher reaching speeds, higher effective ratios,
and success rates. Because of the combination of using Forward Kinematics (FK) for end-effector
tracking, and Inverse Kinematics (IK), allows for adaptable mapping from the operator pose to the
robot pose. Although the direct joint-matching method in GELLO provides accurate control, it is
only suitable for a specific workspace and task size (medium size as defined in our experiment). For
smaller workspaces, or fine tasks that require precise motion, the amplified robot motion in GELLO
has a hard time stabilizing to the given position, resulting in redundant or sub-optimal motion. Our
system ACE utilizes an adaptable approach that first maps the operator’s natural workspace to the
task’s required workspace, and also adjusts the control scale on the robot platform to fit the required
tasks and workspaces. This adaptable approach is only available when we can transfer the scaled
poses with inverse kinematics to solve the robot configurations. This shows that our approach is not
only more generalizable to different robot platforms and end effectors but also adaptable to tasks
and workspaces of different scales.

Imitation Learning
We design six real-world tasks that require multi-step dexterous teleoperation, illustrated in Fig. 8.
Two long horizon tasks, Vacuum Keyboard: 1) grasp the vacuum, 2) activate the vacuum, 3) clean
the keyboard, 4) return the vacuum; Serve Candies: 1) grasp the candy tube, 2) open the cap, 3)
throw the cap into the trash bin, 4) pour candies into the box, and 5) throw the tube into the trash
bin. Wipe Whiteboard: grasps the eraser and wipes the whiteboard. Grasp Dolls: grasps the dolls
one-by-one and put into the basket. Put in Tennis: grasp a tennis ball and put it into the container.
For Grasp Dolls, it requires generalizations to different objects and robot positions. In particular, we
trained on nine types of small dolls and two types of large dolls but tested on 15 types of small dolls
and three types of large dolls. We collected data with ACE system on xArm with Ability Hand and
H1 with Inspire Hand on the above-mentioned tasks. Tab. 3 shows that with ACE, we can efficiently
collect a large number of data with a high success rate.
With the data collected from teleoperation, we train each policy with imitation learning. We use 3D
diffusion policies [52] for imitation learning on xArm platforms and ACT [8] on H1. Specifically, for
diffusion policy, we draw point clouds independently from two camera views, and the proprioception
states as the robot observation and the action space is the target poses of the arm wrists, and hands.

The input for ACT is a single RGB image from a camera mounted at the top of the robot. The
learning results for all tasks are shown in Tab. 3. We tested 10 episodes for each task and showed
the success rate on different tasks.

Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed ACE: a cross-platform visual-exoskeleton system for low-cost dexterous
teleoperation. ACE system employs a hand-facing camera to capture 3D hand poses and an exoskele-
ton mounted on either a fixed or a mobile base. This setup accurately captures both the hand root
end-effector and hand pose in real-time, enabling cross-platform operations with low-cost hardware.
Our system does present two major limitations. The camera mount prevents the wearer’s hands from
coming together and, additionally, increases the burden of rotational movements due to the added
moment arm. Although functionally addressed by our scaled controller, certain operations are less
intuitive.

End-Effector Control Mapping Details
With our different modes of operation, we can accurately map the user’s real-world end effector
(EE) center, which can comfortably and freely draw spheres in physical space, to the center of the
corresponding task’s workspace, while adjusting the control scale.
Algorithm 1 Mapping the Workspace

Hand Retargeting Details
We map the human hand pose data obtained from MediaPipe into joint positions of the teleoperated
robot hand. This process is often formulated as an optimization problem [14], where the difference
between the keypoint vectors of the human and robot hand is minimized. The optimization can be
defined as follows:
15


<!-- page 16 (ocr) -->
min
qt
N
i=0
|αvit −fi(qt)|2 + β |qt −qt−1|2
(2)
subject to:
ql ≤qt ≤qu
where qt represents the joint positions of the robot hand at time step t, vit is the i-th keypoint
vector for the human hand computed from the detected finger keypoints, fi(qt) is the i-th forward
kinematics function which takes the robot hand joint positions qt as input and computes the i-th
keypoint vector for the robot hand, ql and qu are the lower and upper limits of the joint position, and
α is a scaling factor to account for hand size difference. An additional penalty term with weight β
is included to improve temporal smoothness.
C
Target-Reaching Task Details
We designed a target-reaching game to test the key performance parameters of both systems in
simulation. A screenshot of the designed game is shown in Fig. 7, where the only goal is to control
the end-effectors (also represented as spheres) to reach the randomly generated goals. When the goal
for both arms is reached and the end-effectors are kept inside the goals for an assigned keep time, it
is noted as a success and two new goals will be generated in the workspace. We take it as “inside”
depending on the position of the end-effector and the target ball, using the following formula:
1(reached) = ∥pee −ptarget∥<= rtarget −ree
(3)
where p represents for position and r represents for radius, and rtarget > ree all the time. The game
supports various types of robotics arms (with different kinetics), and during our test, we chose XArm
for evaluation.
C.1
Configurations
We construct four different game configurations by varying the workspace, the size of the end-
effector/target balls, along the keep time. The four variants are designed to assess the teleoperation
system’s performance under different conditions by simulating real-world robotic tasks. These sim-
ulation settings correspond to real-world tasks ranging from highly precise operations like micro-
surgery to larger-scale tasks such as handling large objects. Specifically, these setups include:
The ”Small & Small” setup mimics delicate tasks in confined spaces, while the ”Large & Large”
setup reflects operations requiring speed in a larger workspace.
The ”Medium & Small” and
”Medium & Medium” settings represent tasks that balance precision and speed, such as electronics
assembly or general manufacturing operations.
These variants differ in terms of workspace size, end-effector/target region size, and duration the
end-effectors must remain in the goal regions. Their precise game parameters are shown in Tab. 4.
Table 4: The key parameters of the four variants. Note that the workspace, target, and end-effector
are all represented as spheres so the only parameters are their radius.

Experiment Details
Playing process. Each participant first plays general range 2 for 5 times, each time lasting 30
seconds. We have two objectives. First, to allow users to familiarize themselves with the controller
through five relatively simple task scenarios. Second, to record the results of these five attempts
to observe the learnability of the system Then, participants will play general 1, fine, and board for
once. We test only once in other scenarios because both GELLO (the joint copy system) and ACE are
highly intuitive teleoperation systems. We aim to see if users can quickly adapt when encountering
a new scenario for the first time. Additionally, we want to observe the performance of the joint copy
system and the ACE system in task scenarios with varying precision requirements.
Grouping. To ensure the fairness of the experiment and the comparability of the results, targets
appear in the same positions within the identical workspace across tests. Familiarity with the testing
simulation could also affect the outcomes. Therefore, we divided the six testers into two groups. One
group completed the full ACE test before the GELLO test, while the other group did the opposite.
