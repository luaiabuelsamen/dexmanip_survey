over a distribution of physical parameters in simulation, so that the learned policy can be robust against perturbance and transfers to the real world better [13–15]. In DR, it is critical to select the right parameter distribution to ensure a successful transfer [16, 17]. This step is often manually tuned by humans, because it is a challenging optimization problem that requires common sense physical reasoning (e.g., friction is important for walking on different surfaces) and knowledge of the robot system. These characteristics of designing DR parameters make it an ideal problem for LLMs to tackle because of their strong grasp of physical knowledge [1, 18] and effectiveness in _generating hypotheses_ , providing good initializations to complex search and black-box optimization problems in a zero-shot manner [9, 19–22]. In DrEureka, we show that these two distinct capabilities of LLMs can make them effective automated designers for DR configurations. 

**_Abstract_ —Transferring policies learned in simulation to the real world is a promising strategy for acquiring robot skills at scale. However, sim-to-real approaches typically rely on manual design and tuning of the task reward function as well as the simulation physics parameters, rendering the process slow and human-labor intensive. In this paper, we investigate using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and accelerate sim-to-real design. Our LLM-guided sim-to-real approach, DrEureka, requires only the physics simulation for the target task and automatically constructs suitable reward functions and domain randomization distributions to support real-world transfer. We first demonstrate that our approach can discover sim-to-real configurations that are competitive with existing human-designed ones on quadruped locomotion and dexterous manipulation tasks. Then, we showcase that our approach is capable of solving novel robot tasks, such as quadruped balancing and walking atop a yoga ball, without iterative manual design.** 

## I. INTRODUCTION 

However, jointly optimizing for both reward functions and domain randomization parameters requires searching in a vast, infinite-dimensional function space, which is expensive and inefficient for LLMs to perform. Instead, DrEureka decomposes the optimization into three stages: an LLM first synthesizes reward functions, then an initial policy is rolled out in perturbed simulations to create a suitable sampling range for physics parameters, which is finally used by the LLM to generate valid domain randomization configurations. Specifically, to generate the highest quality of reward functions, we build on Eureka [9], a state-of-the-art LLM-based reward design algorithm that can generate free-form, effective reward functions in code. To make Eureka reward functions more amenable for real-world transfer, we propose to include safety instructions in the prompt to automatically generate reward functions that induce safer behavior. Then, equipped with the best reward candidate as well as the associated policy, DrEureka constructs reward-aware physics priors (RAPP) over environment physics parameters by evaluating the policy on various perturbed simulation dynamics; this procedure grounds the effective search ranges for LLM sampling of domain randomization configurations. Finally, the LLM receives the reward-aware prior as context and generates several DR distribution candidates to re-train policies more suitable for real-world deployment. Altogether, DrEureka is a languagemodel driven pipeline for sim-to-real transfer without human intervention. A conceptual overview of the full algorithm is shown in Figure 1. 

Given their internet-scale training data, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as effective sources of common sense priors for robotics [1–6]. Directly synthesizing robot policies from LLMs is difficult because it does not explicitly reason through the physics of the environment, however, when a simulator is available, we can combine the impressive world knowledge of LLMs together with the approximate physics knowledge in the simulator to learn complex low-level skills. Recent works have pursued this intersection and use LLMs to synthesize reward functions [7–9] that can supervise robot reinforcement learning. However, thus far, these approaches have only been used in simulation, and transferring the policies to the real world still requires significant manual tuning of the simulators. In a typical process for sim-to-real policy synthesis, human engineers must manually and iteratively design reward functions and adjust simulation parameters until the configurations converge to enable stable policy learning. [10]. Thus, a natural question is whether we can additionally use LLMs to automate the components in the sim-to-real process that require intensive human efforts. 

In this work, we propose DrEureka ( **D** omain **R** andomization Eureka), a novel algorithm that leverages LLMs to automate reward design and domain randomization parameter configuration simultaneously for sim-to-real transfer. While there are many sim-to-real techniques [11–13], we focus on domain randomization because we believe that it is primed for LLMs to automate. Domain randomization (DR) is a family of approaches that apply randomization 

We evaluate DrEureka on quadruped and dexterous manipulator platforms, demonstrating that our method is general

Fig. 1: DrEureka takes the task and safety instruction, along with environment source code, and runs Eureka to generate a regularized reward function and policy. Then, it tests the policy under different simulation conditions to build a reward-aware physics prior, which is provided to the LLM to generate a set of domain randomization (DR) parameters. Finally, using the synthesized reward and DR parameters, it trains policies for real-world deployment. 

and applicable to diverse robots and tasks. Our experiments focus on these two domains because reward design, domain randomization, and sim-to-real reinforcement learning at large have already established as critical components of effective policy learning strategies within these domains [17, 23–29]. Naturally, there are well-tested, open-sourced simulation environments that provide ideal testbeds for assessing DrEureka’s capability for supervising sim-to-real transfer [23, 26, 30]; as a reference point, our main comparison is with two existing human-designed configurations [25, 30] in order to demonstrate that DrEureka can autonomously achieve useful sim-toreal designs. On quadruped locomotion, DrEureka-trained policies outperform those trained with human-designed reward functions and DR parameters by 34% in forward velocity and 20% in distance travelled across various real-world evaluation terrains. In dexterous manipulation, DrEureka’s best policy performs nearly 300% more in-hand cube rotations than the human-developed policy within a fixed time period. Through extensive ablation studies, we confirm that the components of DrEureka are all essential to generating effective safetyregularized reward functions. Finally, to demonstrate how DrEureka can be used to accelerate sim-to-real on a new task, we test DrEureka on the novel and challenging walking globe task commonly seen in circus, where the quadruped attempts to balance and walk on a yoga ball for as long as possible. Trained with DrEureka, our policy can stay balanced on a real yoga ball for minutes on diverse indoor and outdoor terrains with minimal safety support. 

In summary, our contributions are: 

- 1) DrEureka, an LLM-guided sim-to-real algorithm that can automatically synthesize effective reward and domain randomization designs for sim-to-real transfer;

## II. RELATED WORK 

**Large Language Models for Robotics.** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities as semantic planners [1–3, 31], action models [5, 32, 33], and symbolic programmers [2, 4, 34–41] for robotics applications. Recent works have explored using LLMs to guide the learning of low-level skills via reward function [7–9] and environment design [42, 43]; however, to the best of our knowledge, no prior work has explicitly studied whether LLMs can automate various design aspects of the sim-to-real procedure. In this work, we focus on the two important bottlenecks of reward design and domain randomization and introduce a novel technique that leverages LLMs’ capability as solution generators for challenging optimization problems to automate sim-to-real transfer design. 

**Domain Randomization.** To bridge the gap in physical dynamics between the real world and its simulation counterpart, domain randomization (DR) perturbs simulation physics parameters, such as friction and restitution, to improve the transferability of policies trained in simulation [13–15]. The most common DR approach is to uniformly sample simulation parameters from a fixed distribution [10, 14, 15, 17, 29]. To improve upon this simple randomization strategy, some works propose to automatically adjust the randomization distribution based on simulation training performance [27, 28, 44]. Beyond feedback from simulation, some works have sought to use small amount of real-world policy trajectories to iteratively calibrate the randomization distributions in simulation to better adapt to the real world [45–48]. Despite progress in DR algorithms, the form (i.e., which parameters to randomize) and the initial sampling distributions are typically manually chosen by practitioners with domain expertise, and these design choices have been shown to have large effect on the downstream policy performance [16, 49]. Our work is the first to study whether LLMs can automatically synthesize domain randomization configurations. 

**Sim-to-Real Robot Learning.** Beyond domain randomization, sim-to-real robot learning has been extensively studied in the literature with many complementary techniques, such as system identification [11, 50, 51], domain adaptation [52–56], transfer learning [12], and many others [13]. These approaches differ from domain randomization in that they assume some interaction data with the real-world environment to bridge the sim-to-real gap. At the intersection of sim-to-real and LLMs, prior works have demonstrated policies synthesized in LLMguided simulation training environments can transfer to the real world [7, 8, 42, 57]. However, aspects of the training pipelines pertaining to the sim-to-real transfer itself are still manually designed in these prior works. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to investigate whether LLMs themselves can be used to guide sim-to-real transfer, and in particular, combining automated reward design and domain randomization for highly agile skills. 

## III. PROBLEM SETTING 

We formalize the sim-to-real design problem setting. In a sim-to-real design instance, we assume a target real-world environment and a simulation environment without a built-in reward function or domain randomization configuration. The goal of sim-to-real RL is to train a policy in the simulation environment and then directly transfer it to the target real-world environment without further training. 

Mathematically, the simulation environment can be defined as a Markov Process _M_ = ( _S, A, T_ ), in which _S_ is the environment state space, _A_ the action space, and _T_ the transition function. This assumption is easy to satisfy in practice, e.g., by porting the URDF files of the robot and object models into a simulator. For a task, we represent the true task objective with _F_ : Π _→_ R, which maps a policy to a numerical value that indicates its performance. A sim-to-real algorithm Algo for reward design and domain randomization takes _M_ and task 

specification _l_ task as inputs, and outputs a reward function _R_ and a _distribution_ over transition functions, _T_ : 



Then, a policy learning algorithm _A_ outputs a policy 



which is evaluated in the unknown true MDP (i.e., the real world environment) _M_<sup>_∗_</sup> 



The goal of sim-to-real is to design _P_ and _R_ to maximize _f_<sup>_∗_</sup> : 



Commonly, Algo is a human engineer who manually designs _T_ (i.e., domain randomization) and _R_ (i.e., reward engineering). Specifically, the simulator comes with a set of physics parameters (e.g., mass and friction of objects) _P_ whose values can be set and sampled according to a distribution. Domain randomization (DR) involves (1) selecting a set of physics parameters _{p} ⊆P_ , and (2) selecting a randomization range for each of the chosen parameters. On the other hand, reward engineering tasks the human to write a dense reward function code for task _l_ , and typically involves a trial-and-error procedure where the human observes policies trained using the current reward to design new reward candidates [58–60]. 

In this work, we investigate whether LLMs, equipped with their physical common sense priors and solution generation capability, can guide and automate the sim-to-real design steps. That is, Algo is a LLM that ingests task specification _l_ task in natural language and _M_ as a program, which is satisfied in practice as simulation environments are implemented in code. The LLM then outputs _T_ and _R_ as strings, which are compiled into suitable programmatic formats for downstream policy learning. 

## IV. METHOD 

In this section, we introduce DrEureka, which uses LLMs to automate two important bottlenecks in sim-to-real design: reward design and domain randomization. At a high level, DrEureka first uses the LLM to generate a reward function that is both effective at the task and safe (Section IV-A & IV-B), then uses the resulting simulation policy to construct a prior distribution over randomizable parameters (Section IV-C), and finally instructs the LLM to generate suitable domain randomization configurations based on the prior (Section IV-D). 

## _A. Background: Eureka Reward Design_ 

Our reward design component builds on Eureka [9] due to its simplicity and expressivity but introduces several improvements to enhance its applicability for sim-to-real settings. In Eureka, the LLM first takes the task description _l_ task and a summary of the environment state and action spaces (provided by environment code _M_ ) as input, and then samples several reward functions as code. Each reward function candidate 

is evaluated by training policies via reinforcement learning using that reward, and computing task scores _F_ for these policies. These scores as well as other training statistics (e.g., values of the reward components during training) are provided as feedback to the LLM to iteratively _evolve_ better reward functions that maximize _F_ . The final output of Eureka is the best reward and policy pair 



## _B. Safety Instruction_ 

In Eureka, an implicit assumption is that the target environment _M_<sup>_∗_</sup> _is_ the training simulation environment _M_ . This is undesirable in the sim-to-real setting because a higher simulation score can often be achieved by over-exerting the robot motors or learning unnatural behavior, consequently encouraging the LLM reward candidate sampler to favor reward functions that do not include safety terms (e.g., torque magnitude penalty). To mitigate this problem, one approach is post-hoc adding safety terms to _R_ Eureka. But this approach requires manually defining the safety terms and also fails to consider how the safety terms interact with other task-relevant components in _R_ Eureka. If the scale of the safety term dominates other terms, this approach may inadvertently induce degenerate behavior that is overly conservative [61]. 

Instead, we propose to directly exploit the strong instructionfollowing capability of instruction-tuned LLMs [62] and prompt the LLM to explicitly consider including safety terms for stability, smoothness, and desirable task-specific attributes as a part of the language specification _l_ : 



We hypothesize that this allows the LLM to naturally balance the weighting and potentially non-additive interactions of all reward components, thereby enabling better real-world transfer. See Algorithm 1 for pseudocode. 

## **Algorithm 1** DrEureka Reward Design 

- 1: **Require** : Task description _l_ task, safety instruction _l_ safety, RL algorithm _A_ , environment code _M_ , coding LLM LLM, fitness function _F_ , initial prompt prompt

- 14: **Output** : _R_ DrEureka _, π_ initial 

## _C. Reward-Aware Physics Prior_ 

A safe reward function can regularize the policy behavior fixing a choice of environment, but is not in itself sufficient for sim-to-real transfer. Given _R_ DrEureka and _π_ initial, how should we prompt the LLM to generate effective domain randomization configurations? This is a challenging problem because we do not have access to the real-world environment _M_<sup>_∗_</sup> at training time. However, we do have access to _M_ , which comes with default values for simulation physics parameters. Even so, the default values themselves are not sufficient as guidance for the LLM because they reveal no information about the parameter scales and base ranges to sample. Simulation physical parameters often have built-in ranges (i.e., max and min values), but we hypothesize and validate that these ranges are too wide and may significantly hamper policy learning [10, 16]. 

We introduce a simple _reward aware physics prior (RAPP)_ mechanism to restrict the base ranges for the LLM. At a high level, RAPP seeks for the maximally diverse range of environment parameters that _π_ initial is still performant. Our insight is that domain randomization should be dependent on the task reward function and customized to the policy behavior learned without domain randomization. For instance, randomizing frictions over too wide of a range is likely to sample friction values that are infeasible to learn given the reward function. In practice, for each domain randomization parameter, RAPP computes a lower and upper bound of values that are “feasible” for training. Specifically, we search through a general range of potential values at varying magnitudes, and with each value, we set it in simulation (keeping all other parameters at default) and roll out _π_ Eureka in this modified simulation. If the policy’s performance satisfies a pre-defined success criterion, we deem this value as feasible for this parameter. Given the set of all feasible values for each parameter, our lower and upper bounds for a parameter are the minimum and maximum feasible values. It is computationally light since it requires only evaluating the policies under different physics parameters and can be efficiently done in parallel. 

## **Algorithm 2** Reward Aware Physics Prior (RAPP) 

- 1: **Require** : Reinforcement learning policy _π_ initial, simulator _S_ , success criteria _F_ , domain randomization parameters _P_ and their respective search values _R_ , 

- 2: **for** randomization parameter _p ∈P_ **do** 3: // Initialize output range to extremes 4: _l_ = inf _, h_ = _−_ inf 5: **for** search value _r ∈R_ **do** 6: // Change one randomization parameter while leaving others at default value 

- 7: _S.p_ = _r_ 8: // Evaluate policy in simulation, record trajectory _τ_ 

- 9: _τ_ = _S_ ( _π_ initial) 

- 10: // Evaluate success criteria, update range if successful 

- 11: **if** _F_ ( _τ_ ) **then** 12: _l_ = min( _l, r_ ) 13: _h_ = max( _h, r_ ) 14: **Output** : _l, h_ for each _p ∈P_ 

## _D. LLM for Domain Randomization_ 

Given the RAPP ranges for each DR parameter, the final step of DrEureka instructs the LLM to generate domain randomization configurations within the limits of the RAPP ranges. Compare this to automatic domain randomization [27, 28]: they too search for parameter ranges where the policy performs well, but they directly set the DR parameters to this range. Instead, we use it as a guide for LLM. Our experiments show that this performs better as the base range can be too wide and hampers policy learning. Concretely, we provide all randomizable parameters _P_ and their RAPP ranges in the LLM context and ask the LLM (1) to choose a subset of _{p} ⊆P_ to randomize and (2) determine their randomization ranges. See Figure 3 for the actual domain randomization prompt DrEureka uses in our experiments. In this manner, the backbone LLM zero-shot generates several independent DR configuration samples, _T_ 1 _, ..., Tm_ . Finally, we use RL to train policies for each reward and DR combination, resulting in a set of policies where 



Unlike reward design, it is difficult to select the _best_ DR configuration and policy in simulation as each policy is trained on its own DR distribution and cannot be easily compared. Hence, we keep all _m_ policies and report both the best and the average performance in the real world. Finally, note that some prior works prescribe continuously tuning the DR configuration to adapt to improving policy capabilities over the course of training [27, 28, 44, 46]; we find in practice that the initial DR configurations generated by DrEureka suffice for sim-to-real transfer in our setups without intra-training adaptation. 

## V. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 

**Robots and Tasks.** We adopt commercially available, low-cost robots with well-supported open-sourced simulators as our evaluation platforms. For our main experiments on quadrupedal locomotion, we use Unitree Go1. The Go1 is a small quadrupedal robot with 12 degrees of freedom across four legs. Its observations include joint positions, joint velocities, and a gravity vector in the robot’s local frame, as well as a history of past observations and actions. We use the simulation environment as well as the real-world controller from Margolis et al. [25]. The task of forward locomotion is to walk forward at 2 meters-per-second on flat terrains; while it is possible for the robot to walk forward at a higher speed, we find 2 m/s to strike a good balance between task difficulty and safety as our goal is not to achieve the highest speed possible on the robot. In the real world, we set up a 5-meter track in the lab (see Figure 4) and measure the forward projected velocity and total meters traveled in the track direction. 

> 1In both _Without Prior_ and _Uninformative Prior_ experiments, 15 out of the 16 policies resulted in jerky and dangerous behavior, many times immediately triggering the controller’s motor power protection fault. We count these trials as 0m/s, 0m traveled. 



Fig. 3: DrEureka prompt for generating domain randomization parameters. The blue paragraph describes the instruction, and the green paragraph is the reward aware parameter prior computed in Algorithm 2. 

In addition to locomotion, we validate DrEureka’s applicability to a second task category of dexterous manipulation. Here, we use the LEAP hand [30], which is a low-cost anthropomorphic robot hand, featuring 16 degrees of freedom distributed among three fingers and a thumb. The task involves rotating a cube in-hand as many times as possible within a 20second interval. This task is challenging because the policy only receives 16 joint angles and proprioceptive history, encoded via GRU [63], as observations and does not have access to the position and the pose of the cube. The policy then outputs target joint angles as position commands to the motors. 

Both robots cost less than 10K USD and admit simulators in NVIDIA Isaac Gym [64] with sim-to-real training code that has been tested in the real world. 

**Methods.** DrEureka uses GPT-4 [65] as the backbone LLM, and we use the original Eureka hyperparameters for reward generation before sampling 16 DR configurations. To understand the best and the average performance of DrEureka, we train policies for all 16 configurations and evaluate all policies in the real world. We primarily compare to the human-designed reward function and DR configuration from the original task implementations [25, 30] as reference; We refer to this baseline as Human-Designed. Note that this baseline for forward locomotion trains a velocity-conditioned policy and utilizes a reward function with a velocity curriculum that gradually increases as policy training progresses. For our comparison, we train on the whole curriculum but evaluate the policy at 2 m/s. We emphasize that the purpose of comparing to Human-Designed is to determine whether DrEureka can be _useful_ – i.e., enabling sim-to-real transfer on a representative robot task for which robotics researchers have devoted time 

to designing effective sim-to-real pipelines. The absolute performance ordering is of less importance as LLMs and humans arrive at their respective sim-to-real configurations using vastly different computational and cognitive mechanisms. 

To verify that a policy outputted by a reward-design algorithm itself is not effective for real-world deployment, we also compare against Eureka [9], which designs rewards using LLMs without safety consideration and trains policies without domain randomization. 

Additionally, we consider two classes of DrEureka ablations that probe (1) whether some fixed DR configuration can generally outperform DrEureka samples, and (2) the importance of DrEureka’s reward-aware priors (Section IV-C) and LLM sampling (Section IV-D). In the first class, we first compare to an ablation that does not train with domain randomization ( **No DR** ). Second, we consider a baseline that trains with the human-designed DR ( **Human-Designed DR** ) in the original implementation. Third, we consider a baseline that directly uses the full ranges of the RAPP parameter priors as the DR configuration ( **Prompt DR** ); this ablation can be viewed as applying domain randomization algorithms [27, 28, 44] that seek to prescribe the maximally diverse parameter ranges where the policy performs well as the configurations. In the second category of ablations, we consider an ablation that only has access to the set of physics parameters but without the reward-aware priors ( **No Prior** ). Additionally, we consider an ablation that has only the default search range for RAPP as the parameter priors ( **Uninformative Prior** ). Finally, we consider a baseline that randomly samples from the RAPP ranges ( **Random Sampling** ); this baseline helps show whether LLM-based sampling is a better hypothesis generator. In all ablations, we fix the DrEureka reward function for the task and only modify the DR configurations. 

Finally, we compare DrEureka’s DR-generation with prior methods based on Cross Entropy Method (CEM) [16, 66, 67] and Bayesian Optimization (BayRn) [48, 68], which optimize DR parameters by repeatedly training and evaluating policies in real. Note that while CEM and BayRn tackle the same problem, their iterative procedure is conceptually different from DrEureka, which trains all policies in parallel; thus, this comparison favors the baselines because they use additional information from intermediate real-world evaluations. First, we consider CEM initialized with mean at simulation default values and variance 1 (CEM Random), following [16]. Second, we consider CEM initialized by randomly sampling within the RAPP bounds, (CEM RAPP), which provides a stronger prior. Third, we consider BayRn with parameters bounded by RAPP and initial samples randomly drawn from RAPP (BayRn RAPP). Additional details are in the Appendix. 

**Policy Training and Evaluation.** We train all policies entirely in the simulation environment and use policy training code framework provided by Margolis et al. [25] for forward locomotion and Shaw et al. [30] for cube rotation. For both tasks, the reinforcement learning algorithm is Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [69]. Forward locomotion specifically uses a teacher-student variant of PPO in which the teacher

policy receives privileged state information in simulation to supervise a student policy that uses sensors available in the real world. Adopting the evaluation protocol from Ma et al. [9], we use the original policy training hyperparameters for all policy training and do not modify or tune them for DrEureka’s configurations. Therefore, the differences in performance between DrEureka and Human-Designed can be attributed to the different DR parameters as well as reward functions DrEureka produces. For every DR configuration, we train policies using 3 random seeds and report average as well as standard deviation across trials and seeds. Video results are included on our project website. 

## VI. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 

Our experiments are designed to answer the following: 

- 1) Can DrEureka be competitive with manual, pre-existing Sim2Real pipeline on known tasks? 

- 2) How important is each component of DrEureka? 

- 3) Can DrEureka help solve challenging new tasks for which no prior sim-to-real pipeline exists? 

- _A. Comparison to Pre-Existing Sim-to-Real Configurations_ 

We first directly compare DrEureka to Human-Designed to assess whether DrEureka is capable of providing sim-to-real training configurations comparable to human-designed ones. For forward locomotion, as shown in Table I, DrEureka is able to outperform Human-Designed in terms of both forward velocity as 

well as distance traveled on the track. The performance of DrEureka is robust across its different DR sample outputs; the average performance does not lag too far behind the best DrEureka configuration and still performs on par with or slightly better than Human-Designed. In contrast, the plain Eureka generated policy fails to walk in the real world, validating that a reward design algorithm suitable for simulation is not sufficient for sim-to-real transfer. More details about our experiments comparing DrEureka’s reward against ablations can be found in the Appendix. 

Similarly, for cube rotation, we see in Table II that DrEureka outperforms Human-Designed in terms of rotation while maintaining a competitive time-to-fall duration. We note that this task permits very little room for error; thus, policies generally perform very well or very badly, resulting in the relatively larger standard deviation across DrEureka’s policies. Nevertheless, the best policy from DrEureka significantly outperforms the baseline by nearly three times the rotation without dropping the cube. These results highlight the effectiveness and versatility of our approach across diverse robotic platforms. 

**Real-world robustness.** One main appeal of domain randomization is the robustness of the learned policies to realworld environment perturbations. To probe whether DrEureka policies exhibit this capability, we test DrEureka (Best) and Human-Designed on several additional testing environments for forward locomotion (Figure 4). Within the lab environment, we consider an artificial grass turf as well as putting socks on the quadruped legs. For an outdoor environment, we test on an empty pedestrian sidewalk; the results are shown in Figure 5. We see that across different testing conditions, DrEureka remains performant and consistently matches or outperforms Human-Designed. This validates that DrEureka is capable of producing robust policies in the real world. 

Having validated that DrEureka can be as effective as human-crafted sim-to-real designs in real-world scenarios, we provide further analysis and perform ablations on the quadrupedal locomotion task to better understand the sources of its effectiveness. 

## _B. Does DrEureka generate effective DR configurations?_ 

**DrEureka surpasses DR optimization baselines.** In Table I, we see that BayRn RAPP and CEM RAPP produce worse final policies and are less sample efficient than DrEureka; this is despite the fact that several random initial samples from the RAPP range used to seed BayRn and CEM are reasonably effective. CEM Random performs worse as well since it has no access to the RAPP bounds, causing its variance of 1 to both overshoot and undershoot parameters. These results show that LLM-generated DR can outperform prior feedbackbased approaches. Moreover, since these baselines are iterative, DrEureka incurs a significantly shorter wall-clock runtime of 3 hours, compared to 10 and 20 for CEM and BayRn. Finally, we note that DrEureka avoids testing intermediate real-world policies that can be unsafe, especially for novel tasks like our globe walking task which lack performant controllers.

Fig. 5: **Real-world robustness evaluation.** DrEureka performs consistently across different terrains and maintains advantages over Human-Designed. 

**DrEureka uses physical knowledge to construct DR ranges.** DrEureka takes advantage of the LLM’s physical reasoning capabilities, which serve as a strong prior on DR ranges that are reasonable and intuitive. In the Appendix, we provide an example of the LLM output along with its explanations. We see that the LLM chooses the lower half of the RAPP restitution range, explaining that "restitution affects how the robot bounces off surfaces... lower range as we’re not focusing on bouncing." For gravity, it chooses a relatively small range for "small tweaks to represent minor slopes or variations the robot might need to adapt to." Thus, DrEureka proposes more reasonable DR configurations than CEM and BayRn, which treat DR as a numerical black-box optimization problem and relies on noisy real-world feedback for improving DR parameter proposal. 

**DrEureka outperforms all DR ablations.** The real-world

evaluation of these ablations is included in Table I. We first analyze the group of ablations that fix a single choice of DR configuration or lack thereof. We see that our tasks clearly demand domain randomization as **No DR** is inferior to both DrEureka and Human-Designed. However, finding a suitable DR is not trivial. **Prompt DR** suggests wide parameter ranges (especially over friction as seen in Figure 3) that forces the robot to over-exert forces; this result is validated in Figure 9 where we visualize the histogram of hip torque readings from real-world deployment of DrEureka policies versus **Prompt DR** policies. On the other hand, using **Human-Designed DR** does not match the performance of DrEureka, illustrating the importance of reward-aware domain randomization. Onto the sampling-based baselines, the subpar performance of **Random Sampling** suggests the effectiveness of LLMs as hypothesis generators, consistent with prior works that have found LLMs to be effective for suggesting initial samples for optimization problems [9, 19–22]. However, fully utilizing LLM’s zero-shot generation capability requires proper grounding of the sampling space. **No Prior** and **Uninformative Prior** , despite using a LLM as sampler, performs very poorly and often results in policies that trigger safety protection power cutoff in the real world. One common concern for LLM-based solutions is data leakage, in which the LLM has seen the problems and solutions for an evaluation task. In our setting, if the LLM has seen the simulations tasks and consequently the human-designed ranges in the open-sourced code base, then even if the priors are withheld in the context, it should be possible to output reasonable ranges out of the box. Fortunately, the negative results of **No Prior** confirm that data leakage does not appear in our evaluation. Altogether, these results affirm that both rewardaware parameter priors and LLM as a hypothesis generator in the DrEureka framework are necessary for the best real-world performance. 

## _C. The Walking Globe Trick_ 

Our experiments above have focused on a thorough validation of DrEureka on existing tasks, where a state-of-the-art sim-

TABLE III: **DrEureka results on walking globe.** In both simulation and the real world, the DrEureka policy can balance and walk on the yoga ball for longer than 10 seconds. 

to-real approach was readily available as a reference point. Having validated DrEureka’s ability to automate sim-to-real to comparable performance levels with human design, we now employ DrEureka for a challenging new task. In circus performances, the walking globe trick involves a performer balancing on a large sphere. Inspired by this, we train our quadruped to walk on an inflated yoga ball. The deformable and bouncy nature of the yoga ball complicates this task as IsaacGym simulation does not permit faithfully modeling the resulting complex dynamics of quadruped motion on the ball. See Figure 6 for visualizations of the simulation and the real world environment. This is a novel and arguably more difficult task than most solved quadrupedal tasks. Naturally, there is no pre-existing sim-to-real reward function or domain randomization configuration, making this task an ideal test-bed for DrEureka’s ability to accelerate robot skill discovery. 

The simulation environment is adapted from Ji et al. [70], which simulates the Go1 playing with a small soccer ball. The robot and the ball are allowed to move around a large plane in simulation, but in the lab setting for safety, we limit the robot’s movement by strapping it to a center support point in the room that is kept at the same height as the robot’s center of mass; we use a human as the center point (see left of Figure 6) in order to provide support in the case of falling. The ball is free to move within a radius of 1 meter around this point. We perform DrEureka using the same hyperparameters as in the locomotion task and report policy performance in Table III; we include the DrEureka reward function and DR configurations for this task in Appendix. We observe the quadruped staying 

on the ball for an average of 15.43 seconds in the real world, many times making recovery actions to stabilize the ball and readjust its pose. In simulation, since the policy experiences a wide range of randomization parameters and perturbations, its average episode length is 10.72 seconds. 

Furthermore, given that the lab environment has limited floor space, we also deploy our policy on diverse, uncontrolled outdoor real-world scenes to further test the policy’s robustness. With appropriate controls that limits the speed of the robot, the policy operated effectively for over four minutes under various conditions. Notably, the robot demonstrated stable navigation on grass, adeptly handled transitions over height obstacles, and moved smoothly onto sidewalks and wooden bridges. We also tested the policy’s robustness by introducing perturbations such as kicking the yoga ball and operating the policy as the ball deflated. In all scenarios, the policy successfully managed these challenges, showcasing its adaptability and robustness across diverse operational conditions. See project website for videos. 

In summary, DrEureka’s adeptness at tackling the novel and complex task of quadrupedal globe walking showcases its capacity to push the boundaries of what is achievable in robotic control tasks. This feat, achieved without prior specific sim-to-real pipelines, highlights DrEureka’s potential as a versatile tool in accelerating the development and deployment of robust robotic policies in the real world. 

performance or real-world feedback could further improve the sim-to-real transferability. 

- **Lack of policy selection mechanism** : The evaluation of DrEureka primarily focuses on the effectiveness of the generated reward functions and DR configurations. However, a systematic approach for selecting the most promising policies out of the generated candidates for real-world deployment is not explored. Integrating a mechanism that predicts real-world efficacy based on simulation performance or other heuristics could streamline the process of identifying the best policies for deployment.

## VII. CONCLUSION 

We have presented DrEureka, a novel technique for using large language models to guide sim-to-real reinforcement learning. Without human supervision, DrEureka can automatically generate effective reward functions and domain randomization configurations comparable to human-crafted ones. DrEureka is validated on quadrupedal locomotion and dexterous manipulation, and we have shown its potential in solving novel challenging tasks such as quadruped globe walking. We believe that DrEureka demonstrates the potential of accelerating robot learning research by using foundation models to automate the difficult design aspects of low-level skill learning. 

## VIII. LIMITATIONS 

While DrEureka demonstrates the potential of leveraging LLMs for automating the sim-to-real transfer process in robotics, there are several areas of improvement to the current implementation: 

- **Lack of visual inputs** : The current implementation of DrEureka does not integrate visual data from the environment, relying instead on lower-dimensional state representations. Incorporating vision-based inputs could potentially improve the robustness and generalizability of the learned policies in the real world, where visual cues play a critical role in navigation and interaction. 

- **Static domain randomization parameters** : In the current framework, the domain randomization (DR) parameters, once generated, remain fixed during policy training. Dynamic adjustment of DR parameters based on policy

~~<mark>�</mark>~~ <mark>To make the go1 quadruped run forward with a velocity of exactly 2.0 m/s in the positive x direction of the global coordinate frame. The policy will be trained in simulation and deployed in the real world, so the policy should be as steady and stable as possible with minimal action rate. Specifically, as it’s running, the torso should remain near a z position of 0.34, and the orientation should be perpendicular to gravity. Also, the legs should move smoothly and avoid the DOF limits.</mark> 

~~<mark>�</mark>~~ <mark>�</mark> 

Prompt 2: DrEureka forward locomotion task prompt for reward generation. The safety instructions encouraging a steady torso and smooth movement result in natural gaits. 

~~<mark>�</mark>~~ 

<mark>To make the robot hand rotate the cube in hand with positive angular velocity around the z-axis as many times as possible. We want the cube to remain in the palm with near-zero linear velocity, and it should not fall out of the hand. The policy will be trained in simulation and deployed in the real world, so the policy should be smooth and steady, and the fingers should be penalized for deviating far from their initial position. For safety, we would like the cube to rotate at around 0.25 radians per second; however, it’s okay if it rotates faster.</mark> ~~<mark>�</mark>~~ <mark>�</mark> 

Prompt 3: DrEureka cube rotation task prompt for reward generation. Note that we limit the encouraged rotation speed to 0.25 rad/s due to simulation inaccuracies causing extreme angular velocity measurements; while the policy is not explicitly rewarded for rotating faster than this, we find that faster rotation is implicitly rewarded by greater stability and consistency. 

~~<mark>�</mark>~~ <mark>To make the go1 quadruped balance on the top of the ball. The quadruped should maintain a z-position of 2 * ball_radius or higher. Please keep in mind that the policy learned using your reward terms will be deployed on a robot in the real world. As such, you should prioritize safety, robustness, and feasibility over performance. Please generate reward terms that penalize actions that are unsafe or infeasible. Please also penalize jittery or fast actions that may burn out the motors. Also, remember to keep the scaling of your regularization terms small. If you choose to use env. torques, please keep in mind that this value will be large, so your scaling for this term should be near 0.00001.</mark> 

~~<mark>�</mark>~~ <mark>�</mark> 

Prompt 4: DrEureka globe walking task prompt for reward generation. In our safety instruction, we provide a numerical value to ground torque scaling because env.torques in the code is the output of a black-box model rather than mathematically calculated. 

## _A2. Reward Generation Ablation Prompts_ 

This section contains prompts used in ablation studies, specifically for generating reward functions without safety instructions to assess the impact of such instructions on the generated rewards. 

~~<mark>�</mark>~~

Prompt 5: DrEureka forward locomotion task prompt for reward generation, without safety instructions. 

## _A3. Domain Randomization Generation Prompts_ 

This section includes the initial system and user prompts for generating domain randomization configurations, demonstrating how DrEureka is applied to different tasks for robust policy training. 

~~<mark>�</mark>~~ 

<mark>You are a reinforcement learning engineer. Your goal is to design a set of domain randomization parameters for the given task to facilitate successful deployment of the trained policy in the real world. To do so, you will be given valid parameters as well as a range for each parameter that indicates the maximum and minimum values that parameter can take. Please note that your randomization ranges do not need to cover most of the range. Also, you should keep in mind that the more you randomize, the more difficult it will be for the policy to learn the task within our fixed compute budget. A good policy should be trained only on randomization ranges that will help it adapt to the real world.</mark> 

<mark>You should first reason over each parameter and determine if it’s useful for domain randomization. Then, you should output a range of values for each parameter that you think will be useful for the task in a real-world deployment. Please explain your reasoning for each parameter.</mark> 

<mark>Output your response in the form of Python code that sets the parameters as variables, e.g.: ‘‘‘ friction_range = [0.0, 1.0] ‘‘‘ Please make your variable names match the parameter names provided. Each variable should be assigned a range formatted as a Python list with two elements. Write everything else as Python comments.</mark> ~~<mark>�</mark>~~ <mark>�</mark> 

Prompt 6: DrEureka system prompt for DR generation. 

~~<mark>�</mark>~~ <mark>The task is to train a quadruped robot to run on a variety of terrains indoor and outdoor. The goal of the robot is to run forward at 2.0 m/s while remaining steady and safe in the real world. The robot will be trained in simulation and then deployed in the real world. Our parameters and valid ranges are the following: friction_range = [0.0, 10.0] restitution_range = [0.0, 1.0] added_mass_range = [-5.0, 5.0] com_displacement_range = [-0.1, 0.1] motor_strength_range = [0.5, 2.0] Kp_factor_range = [0.5, 2.0] Kd_factor_range = [0.5, 2.0] dof_stiffness_range = [0.0, 1.0] dof_damping_range = [0.0, 0.5] dof_friction_range = [0.0, 0.01] dof_armature_range = [0.0, 0.01] (This is the range of values added onto the diagonal of the joint inertia matrix.) push_vel_xy_range = [0.0, 1.0] (This is the range of magnitudes of a vector added onto the robot’s xy velocity.) gravity_range = [-1.0, 1.0] (This is the range of values added onto each dimension of [0.0, 0.0, -9.8]. For example, [0.0, 0.0] would keep gravity constant.)</mark> ~~<mark>�</mark>~~ <mark>�</mark> 

Prompt 7: DrEureka quadruped prompt with RAPP from DrEureka policy. This prompt corresponds to the ’Our Method’ configuration in Table I. 

~~<mark>�</mark>~~ <mark>The task is to train a robot hand to rotate the cube in hand. The goal of the robot is to rotate the cube with positive angular velocity around the z-axis as many times as possible while remaining steady and safe in the real world. The robot will be trained in simulation and then deployed in the real world. Our parameters and valid ranges are the following: HandFriction = [0.0, 10.0] HandRestitution = [0.0, 1.0] HandDOFStiffness = [1.0, 10.0] HandDOFDamping = [0.0, 0.5] HandDOFFriction = [0.0, 0.1] HandDOFArmature = [0.0, 0.01] ObjectMass = [0.01, 1.0] # For reference, we measured the real cube to be 0.046 kg ObjectCOM = [-0.01, 0.01] ObjectFriction = [0.0, 10.0] ObjectRestitution = [0.0, 1.0]</mark> ~~<mark>�</mark>~~ <mark>�</mark> 

Prompt 8: DrEureka cube rotation prompt with RAPP from DrEureka policy. This prompt corresponds to the ’Our Method’ configuration in Table II. 

~~<mark>�</mark>~~ <mark>The task is to train a quadruped robot to balance on a yoga ball for as long as possible. The robot will be trained in simulation and then deployed in the real world. Please note that our simulation environment models the ball as a solid rigid object, so the robot will not be able to deform the ball in any way. However, our real yoga ball is hollow, bouncy, and deformable, so the robot will need to adapt to this difference. Please keep this in mind when designing your domain randomization. Our parameters and valid ranges are the following: robot_friction_range = [0.1, 1.0] robot_restitution_range = [0.0, 1.0] robot_payload_mass_range = [-1.0, 5.0] robot_com_displacement_range = [-0.1, 0.1] robot_motor_strength_range = [0.9, 1.1] robot_motor_offset_range = [-0.01, 0.1] ball_mass_range = [0.5, 5.0] ball_friction_range = [0.1, 3.0] ball_restitution_range = [0.0, 1.0] ball_drag_range = [0.0, 1.0] terrain_ground_friction_range = [0.0, 1.0] terrain_ground_restitution_range = [0.0, 1.0] terrain_tile_roughness_range = [0.0, 0.1] robot_push_vel_range = [0.0, 0.5] ball_push_vel_range = [0.0, 0.5] gravity_range = [-0.5, 0.5]</mark> ~~<mark>�</mark>~~ <mark>�</mark>

## _B. DrEureka Outputs_ 

In this section, we detail the reward functions generated by DrEureka and applied in the training of forward locomotion and globe walking task. 

## _B1. LLM-Generated Rewards_

Prompt 14: Final reward for globe walking task from DrEureka. Due to a limitation in the original environment’s codebase, the Eureka reward format here splits each term into a separate function and computes the final reward as a sum of all terms. Besides a minimal change in the prompt to describe this format, everything else is the same. 

## _B2. LLM-Generated Domain Randomizations_ 

In this section, we provide the examples of domain randomization configurations generated by DrEureka given Reward-Aware Physics Prior. 

~~<mark>�</mark>~~ <mark># Friction is important as it affects how the robot interacts with different surfaces (indoor, outdoor). friction_range = [0.5, 5.0] # Moderate range to cover various surfaces like tiles, grass, dirt, etc. # Restitution affects how the robot bounces off surfaces or objects; however, for a running task, this might be less critical. restitution_range = [0.0, 0.5] # Lower range as we’re not focusing on bouncing, but it’s still relevant for minor impacts . # Added mass simulates the effect of carrying additional weight, which could influence stability and motor strength requirements. added_mass_range = [-2.0, 2.0] # A moderate range to simulate carrying light payloads or none. # Center of mass displacement affects stability and maneuverability. com_displacement_range = [-0.05, 0.05] # Slight displacements to ensure the model can handle minor imbalances. # Motor strength directly affects the robot’s ability to move and respond to commands. motor_strength_range = [0.75, 1.75] # A moderate range allowing for variability in motor performance. # Kp_factor (proportional gain) and Kd_factor (derivative gain) influence the control loop’s responsiveness and stability. Kp_factor_range = [0.75, 1.5] # A range that allows for experimenting with control responsiveness without becoming unstable. Kd_factor_range = [0.75, 1.5] # Similar to Kp to ensure controllability under various conditions. # Degrees of freedom (DOF) stiffness and damping affect how rigid and shock-absorbing the joints are, respectively. dof_stiffness_range = [0.2, 0.8] # A range that allows for some variation in joint stiffness without being too rigid or floppy. dof_damping_range = [0.1, 0.4] # Provides variability in how the robot absorbs shocks and returns to equilibrium.</mark> 

<mark># DOF friction and armature values are very specific parameters that could affect energy efficiency and precision in movements. dof_friction_range = [0.0, 0.005] # Small range based on the minor impact it has on performance but still considering efficiency. dof_armature_range = [0.0, 0.005] # Minimally varies the joint inertia to see the effects on stability and precision. # Push velocity in the xy plane simulates external forces or disturbances, e.g., wind or collisions. push_vel_xy_range = [0.0, 0.5] # A range to help the robot learn to stabilize against moderate disturbances. # Gravity variations can simulate different loading conditions or slight inclines/declines the robot might face. gravity_range = [-0.2, 0.2] # Small tweaks to represent minor slopes or variations the robot might need to adapt to. # Note: Each range is chosen with the thought of exposing the robot to a variety of conditions it might face in the real world # without making the task unnecessarily difficult to learn within our compute budget.</mark> ~~<mark>�</mark>~~ <mark>�</mark> 

Generation 1: Example DrEureka DR configuration for forward locomotion.

Since real robotic hands might have varying joint frictions, # a small range can simulate these differences without compromising the hand’s basic functionality. randomizeHandDOFFrictionLower: 0.01 randomizeHandDOFFrictionUpper: 0.05 # HandDOFArmature refers to the inertia of the hand joints, which could slightly vary in reality but typically remains low . # We’ll randomize it minimally as it’s less critical for cube rotation but still worth considering for physical accuracy. randomizeHandDOFArmatureLower: 0.001 randomizeHandDOFArmatureUpper: 0.005 # ObjectMass is directly measured, but slight variations in mass distribution or accuracy of the measurement can occur. # Thus, randomizing around the measured value simulates handling cubes of slightly different masses. randomizeObjectMassLower: 0.04 randomizeObjectMassUpper: 0.05 # ObjectCOM (Center of Mass) might shift slightly in real objects depending on manufacturing variances. # Small randomization here can help the policy cope with such variances in balancing the cube during rotation. randomizeObjectCOMLower: -0.005 randomizeObjectCOMUpper: 0.005 # ObjectFriction affects how easily the cube rotates within the grasp. Since surface materials can vary greatly, # a broader range here assists in preparing the policy for different cube surfaces. randomizeObjectFrictionLower: 1.0 randomizeObjectFrictionUpper: 8.0 # ObjectRestitution represents how bouncy the cube is when dropped or thrown, which is less relevant for rotations, # but slight variations might simulate interactions with the environment more realistically. randomizeObjectRestitutionLower: 0.0 randomizeObjectRestitutionUpper: 0.3</mark> ~~<mark>�</mark>~~ <mark>�</mark> 

Generation 2: Example DrEureka DR configuration for cube rotation. 

~~<mark>�</mark>~~ <mark># Friction between the robot and the ball is crucial because it affects how well the robot can balance and maneuver on the ball. Since the real ball can be less predictable, a wider range should promote adaptability. robot_friction_range = [0.1, 1.0]</mark> 

<mark># Restitution, or bounciness, will affect how the robot interacts with surfaces upon collision. Though the simulation does not account for ball deformation, varying restitution can simulate the unpredictability of these interactions. robot_restitution_range = [0.2, 0.8]</mark> 

<mark># Since the payload will directly affect the robot’s balance and how it responds to shifts in weight, we allow for variability but avoid extreme negative values to maintain realism.</mark> 

<mark>robot_payload_mass_range = [0.0, 3.0]</mark> 

<mark># Center of mass displacement affects balance and stability. Randomization within a moderate range can prepare the robot for shifts in its own weight distribution.</mark> 

<mark>robot_com_displacement_range = [-0.05, 0.05]</mark> 

<mark># Motor strength is critical for moving and balancing. A narrow range ensures the robot remains capable of movement but can adapt to variability in its actuation power.</mark> 

<mark>robot_motor_strength_range = [0.95, 1.05]</mark> 

<mark># Motor offsets will simulate imperfections in actuator performance. Randomizing this could prepare the robot for realworld inaccuracies.</mark> 

<mark>robot_motor_offset_range = [-0.005, 0.05]</mark> 

- <mark># The ball’s mass will significantly impact how the robot interacts with it. Since the ball is hollow and can be deformed, a middle-range should provide a good balance between too light and too heavy.</mark> 

- <mark>ball_mass_range = [1.0, 3.0]</mark> 

<mark># Ball friction and restitution are critical for preparing the robot to interact with a bouncy and deformable ball. These ranges allow for significant variability. ball_friction_range = [0.5, 2.5] ball_restitution_range = [0.4, 0.9]</mark> 

<mark># Ball drag simulates air resistance, which could affect interactions at higher speeds. ball_drag_range = [0.1, 0.5]</mark> 

<mark># The robot might not always operate on similar terrains, so simulating a range of frictions can be beneficial. However, the restitution of the ground is less critical here.</mark> 

<mark>terrain_ground_friction_range = [0.2, 0.8] terrain_ground_restitution_range = [0.0, 0.5]</mark> 

<mark># Terrain roughness could influence balance and traction, so a slight variation can introduce realistic challenges without overwhelming the learning process. terrain_tile_roughness_range = [0.02, 0.08]</mark> 

<mark># Varying the push velocities can help the robot learn to maintain balance against unexpected forces. robot_push_vel_range = [0.1, 0.4] ball_push_vel_range = [0.1, 0.4]</mark> 

<mark># Considering the task does not involve drastic changes in gravity, we only slightly vary this to simulate minor differences in weight sensation. gravity_range = [-0.1, 0.1]</mark> ~~<mark>�</mark>~~

Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback: (1) If the task score is always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter (b) Re-writing the reward component (c) Discarding the reward component</mark> 

<mark>(3) If some reward components magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code . The output of the reward function should be only your reward value. The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "‘‘‘python ... ‘‘‘". Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code: (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components</mark> 

<mark>(2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable (3) Most importantly, the reward codes must only use attributes of the provided environment object (namely, variables that have prefix env.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.</mark>

<mark>Eureka Output: From the policy feedback, it seems that the reward for height (’rew height’) and balance (’rew balance’) are significant and show improvement, but the reward for smooth actions (’rew smooth actions’) needs more optimization. I will increase the scale for smooth_actions_reward and introduce an exponential reward component for height_reward so that the reward gradient is smoother. Here is the updated reward function: ‘‘‘python def _reward_height(self): env = self.env height_threshold = 2.0 * env.ball_radius height_temperature = 10.0 # new temperature parameter for exponential transformation height_exp = torch.exp((env.base_pos[:, 2] - height_threshold) / height_temperature) height_reward = torch.where(env.base_pos[:, 2] >= height_threshold, height_exp, torch.zeros_like(env.base_pos[:, 2])) return 2.0 * height_reward # increase scale of height_reward def _reward_balance(self): env = self.env ball_top = env.object_pos_world_frame + torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, env.ball_radius], device=env.device).unsqueeze(0) feet_dist_to_ball_top = torch.norm(env.foot_positions - ball_top.unsqueeze(1), dim=-1) balance_reward = 1.0 - torch.mean(feet_dist_to_ball_top, dim=-1) return 1.0 * balance_reward def _reward_smooth_actions(self): env = self.env action_diff = env.actions - env.last_actions smooth_actions_reward = -torch.mean(torch.abs(action_diff), dim=-1) return 0.5 * smooth_actions_reward # increase scale of smooth_actions_reward ‘‘‘ In this updated reward function, I introduced a temperature parameter (‘height_temperature‘) and applied an exponential transformation to the height_reward so that the reward gradient is smoother. I also multiplied the height_reward scale by 2 to make it more significant. Finally, I increased the scale of the smooth_actions_reward by 0.5 to encourage smoother actions more than before, which will help further improve the policy. #################################################################################################### Reward Reflection: We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as task score and episode lengths after every 500 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered: task score: [’12.42’, ’65.13’, ’71.19’, ’76.92’, ’100.98’, ’320.91’, ’602.55’, ’741.82’, ’865.37’, ’924.64’], Max: 1040.59, Mean: 407.71, Min: 12.42 episode length: [’11.45’, ’65.14’, ’71.13’, ’76.80’, ’100.93’, ’330.90’, ’608.89’, ’767.77’, ’903.78’, ’903.98’], Max: 1074.86, Mean: 409.03, Min: 11.45 rew balance: [’8.28’, ’41.57’, ’44.23’, ’47.64’, ’64.50’, ’237.34’, ’464.35’, ’574.94’, ’673.07’, ’722.61’], Max: 811.20, Mean: 310.16, Min: 8.28 rew height: [’25.01’, ’108.71’, ’122.09’, ’133.27’, ’181.14’, ’620.04’, ’1187.27’, ’1468.28’, ’1718.10’, ’1837.45’], Max: 2076.23, Mean: 797.53, Min: 25.01 rew smooth actions: [’-6.52’, ’-35.68’, ’-38.78’, ’-42.31’, ’-66.38’, ’-271.25’, ’-508.06’, ’-624.86’, ’-740.29’, ’-808.17 ’], Max: -6.52, Mean: -340.10, Min: -911.98 rew total: [’26.76’, ’114.60’, ’127.55’, ’138.60’, ’179.26’, ’586.13’, ’1143.56’, ’1418.36’, ’1650.88’, ’1751.89’], Max:</mark>

## _D. Experimental Setup_ 

## _D1. Forward Locomotion_ 

For the forward locomotion task, our policy takes joint positions, joint velocities, a gravity vector, and a history of past observations and actions as input. It produces joint position commands for a PD controller, which has a proportional gain of 20 and derivative gain of 0.5. 

We extend the simulation setup from Margolis et al. [25], and we include additional domain randomization parameters, specifically joint stiffness, damping, friction, and armature that were not in the their work. These parameters, along with the others in Table XII, were randomized during training. We chose these parameters based on IsaacGym’s documentation on rigid body, rigid shape, and DOF properties<sup>2</sup> . 

|Property|Valid Range|RAPP Search Range|
|---|---|---|

|dof damping|[0_, ∞_)<br>|[0_,_10]<br>|
|dof friction|[0_, ∞_)<br>|[0_,_10]<br>|
|dof armature|[0_, ∞_)|[0_,_10]|



TABLE XII: **Domain randomization parameters for forward locomotion, along with their valid ranges and RAPP search ranges.** Though the scale of these parameters differs, each RAPP range is chosen from one of four general-purpose ranges (0_to_infty, 0_to_1, centered_0, centered_1). 

> 2Relevant functions in the documentation are isaacgym.gymapi.RigidBodyProperties, isaacgym.gymapi.RigidShapeProperties, isaacgym.gymapi.Gym.get_actor_dof_properties(). Note that among these properties, there are a few fields that we found had no effect in simulation. We discarded them for our domain randomization. 

## _D2. Cube Rotation_ 

For the cube rotation task, we follow the training and deployment workflow outlined by the LeapHand authors. For training all the policies, we use the same GRU architecture that receives 16 joint angles as input and outputs 16 target joint angles. We also follow the LeapHand training code to randomize the initial pose of the hand and the size of the cube. When deploying trained policies in the real world, the target joint angles are passed as position commands to a PID controller running at 20 Hz. 

In addition to the initial pose of the hand and the size of the cube, the Human Designed policy is trained with DR in object mass, object center of mass, hand friction, stiffness and damping. In DrEureka, we extend the simulation setup to include additional domain randomization parameters, such as hand restitution, joint friction, armature, object friction and object restitution. These parameters, along with the others, are detailed in Table XIII. 

|Property|Valid Range|RAPP Search Range|
|---|---|---|
|object mass|[0_, ∞_)|[0_._01_,_1]|
|object center of mass|[0_, ∞_)|[_−_0_._01_,_0_._01]|

|dof friction|[0_, ∞_)|[0_,_0_._1]|
|armature|[0_, ∞_)|[0_,_0_._01]|
|object friction|[0_, ∞_)|[0_,_10]|
|object restitution|[0_,_1]|[0_,_1]|



TABLE XIII: **Domain randomization parameters for cube rotation, along with their valid ranges and RAPP search ranges.** 

## _D3. Globe Walking_ 

For globe walking, we largely extend the framework from forward locomotion, with a few exceptions. First, the policy takes in an additional yaw sensor as input. Second, to account for actuator inaccuracies in the real world, we use an actuator network from Ji et al. [70]; this network is pretrained on log data to predict real robot torques from joint commands, and we use it to compute torques from actions in simulation when training the quadruped. Third, we have additional domain randomization parameters, shown in Table XIV. 

In the real world, we deploy our quadruped on a 34-inch yoga ball. We did not have a stable pole to tether our quadruped, so we instead resort to a human holding the end of the leash; however, we are careful to hold the leash parallel to the ground to ensure that the human does not provide any upward force that might aid the robot, and our sole purpose is to keep the robot within a safe radius.

TABLE XV: **Ablations result.** Ablations of the DR formulation in DrEureka all result in decreased performance. 



Fig. 9: Policies trained on DrEureka DR configurations exert less torque in the real world. 

## _E. Additional Ablation Results_ 

**Sampling from DrEureka priors enables stable simulation training.** To better understand the drastically different performances of different DrEureka prior choices in the real world, we present the simulation training curves in Figure 10. Note that the performances are not directly comparable as each method is trained and evaluated on its own DR distributions. Nevertheless, we observe the stable training progress of DrEureka. In contrast, despite using a LLM, the ablations synthesize poor DR ranges, resulting in difficult policy training dynamics. 

**DrEureka does not need a reward curriculum.** To study the effectiveness of the reward functions in isolation, we fix the domain randomization configurations to be Human-Designed for both DrEureka and Human-Designed reward functions and re-train several policies in simulation. Since Human-Designed reward utilizes a velocity curriculum, we also

evaluate an ablation of the Human-Designed reward function that has a fixed velocity target (i.e., 2.0 m/s) to put it on an equal footing with the Eureka reward function as a standalone reward function. The training curves are shown in Figure 12. As shown, DrEureka reward enables more sample-efficient training and reaches higher asymptotic performance. In contrast, the Human-Designed reward crucially depends on the explicit curriculum to work comparably; as a stand-alone reward function without curriculum inputs, Human-Designed makes little progress. 

**Safety instruction enables safe reward functions.** In addition to comparing against human-written reward functions, we also ablate DrEureka’s own reward design procedure. In particular, to verify that DrEureka’s safety instruction yields more deployable reward functions, we compare to an ablation of DrEureka that does not include custom safety suggestions in the prompt; see Table VI for the functional form of this reward function. Note that this ablation is identical to the original Eureka algorithm in Table I, and we compare it to the DrEureka (No DR) variant to eliminate the influence of domain randomization in policy performance. As shown in Table XVI, removing the safety prompt results in a final reward function that can move faster in simulation than DrEureka. However, the robot acquires an unnatural gait with three of its feet and the hip dragging on the ground. Consequently, in the real world, this behavior does not transfer, and the policy directly face-plants at the starting line; this is not surprising as the Eureka reward function contains just a generic action smoothing term for safety, which in itself does not prohibit awkward behaviors. Example snapshots are included in Figure 13; See our project website for a video comparison.

## _F. CEM and BayRn Baseline Details_ 

In this section, we detail our DR baseline procedure for Cross Entropy Method (CEM) [16, 66, 67] and Bayesian Optimization (BayRn) [48, 68]. On a high level, both algorithms optimize DR parameters by repeatedly training and evaluating policies in real. Over multiple iterations, CEM trains policies on DR configurations _Ti, . . . , Tj_ sampled from distribution _p_ , evaluates their real-world performance _Ji, . . . , Jj_ , and updates _p_ to fit the _k_ "elite" samples with highest _J_ . BayRn initially trains and evaluates multiple sampled DR configurations _T_ 0 _, . . . , Ti_ , then fits a surrogate model _G_ on ( _T_ 0 _, J_ 0) _, . . . ,_ ( _Ti, Ji_ ); next, for multiple iterations, BayRn uses _G_ and acquisition function _a_ to select the next DR configuration _Tj_ to train and evaluate, then updates _G_ with ( _Tj, Jj_ ). 

For BayRn, we select the widely used Matérn 2.5 kernel and the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) as the acquisition function with parameter _κ_ = 5 and _ξ_ = 1. To maintain the same sample complexity of 16, we run CEM for 4 iterations with 4 samples each and BayRn with 8 initial samples, then 8 iterations with 1 sample each.
