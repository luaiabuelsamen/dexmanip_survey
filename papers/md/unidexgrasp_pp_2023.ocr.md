Figure 1: In this work, we present a novel dexterous grasping policy learning pipeline, UniDexGrasp++.
Same to
UniDexGrasp[71], UniDexGrasp++ is trained on 3000+ different object instances with random object poses under a table-top
setting. It significantly outperforms the previous SOTA and achieves 85.4% and 78.2% success rates on the train and test set.
Abstract
We propose a novel, object-agnostic method for
learning a universal policy for dexterous object grasp-
ing from realistic point cloud observations and propri-
oceptive information under a table-top setting, namely
UniDexGrasp++. To address the challenge of learn-
ing the vision-based policy across thousands of object
instances, we propose Geometry-aware Curriculum
Learning (GeoCurriculum) and Geometry-aware it-
erative Generalist-Specialist Learning (GiGSL) which
leverage the geometry feature of the task and signif-
icantly improve the generalizability.
With our pro-
posed techniques, our final policy shows universal dex-
terous grasping on thousands of object instances with
85.4% and 78.2% success rate on the train set and
test set which outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline
UniDexGrasp by 11.7% and 11.3%, respectively.

1. Introduction
Robotic grasping is a fundamental and extensively stud-
ied problem in robotics, and it has recently gained broader
attention from the computer vision community.
Recent
works [62, 6, 18, 24, 67, 17, 13] have made significant
progress in developing grasping algorithms for parallel
grippers, using either reinforcement learning or motion
planning. However, traditional parallel grippers have lim-
ited flexibility, which hinders their ability to assist humans
in daily life.
Consequently, dexterous grasping is becoming more im-
portant, as it provides a more diverse range of grasping
strategies and enables more advanced manipulation tech-
niques. The high dimensionality of the action space (e.g.,
24 to 30 degrees of freedom) of a dexterous hand is a key
advantage that provides it with high versatility and, at the
same time, the primary cause of the difficulty in executing a
successful grasp. What’s more, the complex hand articula-
tion significantly degrades motion planning-based grasping

methods, making RL the mainstream of dexterous grasping.
However, it is very challenging to directly train a vision-
based universal dexterous grasping policy [37, 38, 40, 59].
First, vision-based policy learning is known to be difficult,
since the policy gradients from RL are usually too noisy to
update the vision backbone. Second, such policy learning
is in nature a multi-task RL problem that carries huge varia-
tions (e.g., different geometry and poses) and is known to be
hard [40, 29, 59]. Despite recent advancements in reinforce-
ment learning (RL) [4, 2, 37, 8, 9, 49, 41, 27, 38, 58, 69]that
have shown promising results in complex dexterous manip-
ulation, the trained policy cannot easily generalize to a large
number of objects and the unseen. At the same time, most
works [4, 2, 69, 9, 58, 49, 27] assume the robot knows
all oracle information such as object position and rotation,
making them unrealistic in the real world.
A recent work, UniDexGrasp [70], shows promising re-
sults in vision-based dexterous grasping on their benchmark
that covers more than 3000 object instances.
Their pol-
icy only takes robot proprioceptive information and realis-
tic point cloud observations as input. To ease policy learn-
ing, UniDexGrasp proposes object curriculum learning that
starts RL with one object and gradually incorporates similar
objects from the same categories or similar categories into
training to get a state-based teacher policy. After getting
this teacher policy, they distill this policy to a vision-based
policy using DAgger [51]. It finally achieves 73.7% and
66.9% success rates on the train and test splits. One limi-
tation of UniDexGrasp is that its state-based teacher policy
can only reach 79.4% on the training set, which further con-
strains the performance of the vision-based student policy.
Another limitation in the object curriculum is unawareness
of object pose and reliance on category labels.
To overcome these limitations, we propose UniDex-
Grasp++, a novel pipeline that significantly improves the
performance of UniDexGrasp. First, to improve the per-
formance of the state-based teacher policy, we first propose
Geometry-aware Task Curriculum Learning (GeoCurricu-
lum) that measures the task similarity based on the ge-
ometry feature of the scene point cloud.
To further im-
prove the generalizability of the policy, we adopt the idea
of generalist-specialist learning [63, 39, 23, 29] where
a group of specialists is trained on the subset of the
task space then distill to one generalist. We further pro-
pose Geometry-aware iterative Generalist-Specialist Learn-
ing GiGSL where we use the geometry feature to de-
cide which specialist handles which task and iteratively do
distillation and fine-tuning. Our method yields the best-
performing state-based policy, which achieves 87.9% and
83.7% success rate on the train set and test set. Then we
distill the best-performing specialists to a vision-based gen-
eralist and do GiGSL again on vision-based policies until it
reaches performance saturation. With our full pipeline, our
final vision-based policy shows universal dexterous grasp-
ing on 3000+ object instances with 85.4% and 78.2% suc-
cess rate on the train set and test set that remarkably outper-
forms the state-of-the-art baseline UniDexGrasp by 11.7%
and 11.3%, respectively.
The additional experiment on
Meta-World [73] further demonstrates the effectiveness of
our method which outperforms the previous SOTA multi-
task RL methods.
2. Related Work
2.1. Dexterous Grasping
Dexterous hand has received extensive attention for its
potential for human-like manipulation in robotics [53, 52,
43, 14, 3, 12, 33, 32, 41, 36, 45, 35]. It is of high poten-
tial yet very challenging due to its high dexterity. Dexter-
ous grasping is a topic of much interest in this field. Some
works [5, 15, 3] have leveraged analytical methods to model
the kinematics and dynamics of both hands and objects, but
they typically require simplifications, such as using sim-
ple finger and object geometries, to ensure the feasibility
of the planning process. Recent success has been shown in
using reinforcement learning and imitation learning meth-
ods [8, 9, 49, 41, 27, 4, 58, 69]. While these works have
shown encouraging results, they all suppose that the robot
can get all the oracle states (e.g., object position, velocity)
during training and testing. However, this state information
can not be easily and accurately captured in the real world.
To mitigate this issue, some works [38, 37, 46, 70] consider
a more realistic setting with the robot proprioception and
RGB image or 3D scene point cloud as the input of the pol-
icy which can be captured more easily in the real world. Our
work is more related to the recently proposed work UniDex-
Grasp [70] which learns a vision-based policy over 3000+
different objects. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline
that significantly improves the performance and generaliza-
tion of UniDexGrasp, namely UniDexGrasp++.
2.2. Vision-based Policy Learning
Extensive research has been conducted to explore the
learning of policies from visual inputs [74, 30, 60, 72, 61,
22, 21, 20]. To ease the optimization and training process,
some works have utilized a pre-trained vision model and
frozen the backbone, as shown in works such as [57, 48, 56].
Others, such as [69, 68], have employed multi-stage train-
ing. Our work is more related to [8, 7, 70], who firstly train
a state-based policy and then distill to a vision-based pol-
icy. Also, our work makes good use of the pre-training of
vision-backbone in the loop of imitation (supervised) learn-
ing and reinforcement learning which enables us to train a
generalizable policy under the vision-based setting.

icy Distillation

ject geometry, task semantics) in policy learning, previ-

Figure 2: Method Overview. We propose to first adopt a state-based policy learning stage followed by a vision-based policy
learning stage. The state-based policy takes input robot state Rt, object state St, and the geometric feature z of the scene
point cloud of the first frame. We leverage a geometry-aware task curriculum (GeoCurriculum) to learn the first state-based
generalist policy. After that, this generalist policy is further improved via iteratively performing specialist fine-tuning and
distilling back to the generalist in our proposed geometry-aware iterative generalist-specialist learning (GiGSL), where the
task assignment to which specialist is decided by our geometry-aware clustering (GeoClustering). For vision-based policy
learning, we first distill the final state-based specialists to an initial vision-based generalist and then do GiGSL for the vision
generalist, until we obtain the final vision-based generalist with the highest performance.
ous works have used imitation learning including behav-
ior cloning [64, 31], augmenting demonstrations to Rein-
forcement Learning [49, 69, 47, 59, 16] and Inverse Rein-
forcement Learning [42, 1, 26, 19, 34] to utilize the expert
demonstrations or policies. Some works [63, 39, 23, 29]
have adopted the Generalist-Speciliast Learning idea in
which a group of specialists (teacher) is trained on a sub-
set of the task space, and then distill to a single gener-
alist (student) in the whole task space using the above
imitation learning and policy distillation methods. While
these works have made great progress on several bench-
marks [40, 73, 28, 65, 11], they either do not realize the
importance of how to divide the tasks or environment vari-
ations for specialists or focus on a different setting to our
method. In this work, we leverage the geometry feature of
the task in the specialists’ division and curriculum learning
which greatly improves the generalizability.
3. Problem Formulation
In this work, we focus on learning a universal policy
for dexterous object grasping from realistic point cloud ob-
servations and proprioceptive information under a table-top
setting, similar to [70, 46].
We learn such a universal policy from a diverse set of
grasping tasks. A grasping task is defined as τ = (o, R),
where o ∈O is an object instance from the object dataset
O, and R ∈SO(3) is the initial 3D rotation of the object.
To construct the environment, we randomly sample an ob-
ject o, let it fall from a height, which randomly decides an
initial pose, and then move the object center to the center of
the table. We always initialize the dexterous hand at a fixed
pose that is above the table center. The task is successful if
the position difference between the object and the target is
smaller than a threshold value. This is a multi-task policy
learning setting and we require our learned policy to gener-
alize well across diverse grasping tasks, e.g., across random
initial poses and thousands of objects including the unseen.
4. Method
This section presents a comprehensive description of
our proposed method for solving complex tasks.
In
Sec. 4.1, we provide an overview of our approach along
with the training pipeline.
Our proposed method lever-
ages DAgger-based distillation and iterative Generalist-
Specialist Learning (iGSL) strategy, which is explained in
detail in Sec. 4.2. Moreover, we introduce Geometry-aware
Clustering to decide which specialist handles which task,
achieving Geometry-aware iterative Generalist-Specialist
Learning (GiGSL), which is presented in Sec. 4.3.
In
Sec. 4.4, we present a Geometry-aware Task Curriculum
Learning approach for training the first state-based gener-
alist policy.
4.1. Method Overview
Following [70, 8, 7], we can divide our policy learning
into two stages: 1) the state-based policy learning stage; 2)
the vision-based policy learning stage. It is known that di-
rectly learning a vision-based policy is very challenging, we
thus first learn a state-based policy that can access oracle in-
formation and let this policy help and ease the vision-based
policy learning. The full pipeline is shown in Figure 2.

is to obtain a universal policy, or we call it a generalist, that
takes inputs from robot state Rt, object state Ot, and the
scene point cloud Pt=0 at the first frame. Here the object
point cloud is fused from multiple depth point clouds cap-
tured by multi-view depth cameras. And we include Pt=0
in the input to retain the scene geometry information and we
use the encoder of a pre-trained point cloud autoencoder to
extract its geometry feature. Note that at this point cloud en-
coder is frozen to make it as simple as possible, so it doesn’t
interfere with policy learning. We leave the visual process-
ing of Pt to the vision-based policy.
Although learning a state-based policy through rein-
forcement learning is more manageable than learning a
vision-based policy, it is still very challenging to achieve
a high success rate under such a diverse multi-task set-
ting. We thus propose a geometry-aware curriculum learn-
ing (GeoCurriculum) to ease the multi-task RL and im-
prove the success rate.
After this GeoCurriculum, we obtain the first state-
based generalist SG1 that can handle all tasks. We then
propose a geometry-aware iterative Generalist-Specialist
Learning strategy, dubbed as GiGSL, to further improve
the performance of the generalist. This process involves
iterations between learning several state-based specialists
{SSi} that specialize in a specific range of tasks and dis-
tilling the specialists to a generalist SGi+1, where i denotes
the iteration index. The overall performance kept improving
through this iterative learning until saturation.
Vision-based policy learning.
For vision-based policy,
we only allow it to access information available in the
real world, including robot state Rt and the scene point
clouds Pt.
In this stage, we need to jointly learn a vi-
sion backbone B that extracts ft from Pt along with our
policy (see the blue part of Fig.2). Here we adopt Point-
Net+Transformer [40] as B, which we find has a larger ca-
pacity and thus outperforms PointNet [44]. We randomly
initialize the network weight of our first vision generalist
VG1. We start with performing a cross-modal distillation
that distills the latest state-based specialists {SSn} to VG1.
We can then start the GiGSL cycles for vision-based poli-
cies that iterate between finetuning {VSi} and distilling to
VGi+1 until the performance of the vision-based general-
ist saturates. The final vision-based generalist VGfinalis our
learned universal grasping policy that yields the highest per-
formance. Please refer to supplementary material for the
pseudo-code of the whole pipeline.
4.2. iGSL: iterative Generalist-Specialist Learning
Recap Generalist-Specialist Learning (GSL). The idea
of Generalist-Specialist Learning comes from a series of
works [63, 39, 23, 29] that deal with multi-task policy learn-
ing. The most recent paper [29] proposes GSL, a method
that splits the whole task space into multiple subspaces and
lets one specialist take charge of one subspace. Since each
subspace has fewer task variations and thus is easier to
learn, each specialist can be trained well and perform well
on their task distributions. Finally, all the specialists will be
distilled into one generalist.
Note that [29] only has one cycle of specialist learn-
ing and generalist learning. Straightforwardly, more cycles
may be helpful.
In GSL, the distillation is implemented
using GAIL [26] or DAPG [49] but we find their perfor-
mance mediocre. In this work, we propose a better policy
distillation method based on DAgger, iteratively enabling
Generalist-Specialist Learning.
Dagger-based policy distillation. DAgger [51] is an on-
policy imitation learning algorithm. Different from GAIL
or DAPG, which only require expert demonstrations, DAg-
ger [51] requires an expert policy, which is called a teacher,
and the student that takes charge of interacting with the en-
vironment. When the student takes action, the teacher pol-
icy will use its action to serve as supervision to improve
the student. Given that the student always uses its policy to
interact with the environment, such imitation is on-policy
and thus doesn’t suffer from the covariate shift problem
usually seen in the behavior cloning algorithm. Previous
works, such as [70] for dexterous grasping and [8, 7] for
in-hand manipulation, have used DAgger for policy distilla-
tion from a state-based teacher to a vision-based student and
it is shown in UniDexGrasp [70] that DAgger outperforms
GAIL and DAPG for policy distillation.
However, one limitation of DAgger is that it only cares
about the policy network and discards the value networks
that popular actor-critic RL like PPO [55] and SAC [25]
usually have. In this case, when a teacher comes with both
an actor and a critic distills to a student, the student will only
have an actor without a critic and thus can’t be further fine-
tuned using actor-critic RL. This limits GSL to simply one
cycle and hinders it from further improving the generalist.
To mitigate this issue, we propose a new distillation
method that jointly learns a critic function while learning
the actor using DAgger.
Our DAgger-based distillation
learns both a policy and a critic function during the super-
vised policy distillation process, where the policy loss is
the mean squared error (MSE) between the actions from the
teacher policy πteacher and the student policy πθ (same in
DAgger), and the critic loss is the MSE between the pre-
dicted value function Vφ and the estimated returns ˆRt using
Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) [54].

This DAgger-based distillation method allows us to re-
tain both the actor and critic while achieving very high per-
formance. Compared to ILAD [69] that only pre-trains the

actor and directly finetunes the actor-critic RL (the critic
network is trained from scratch), our method enables actor-
critic RL to fine-tune on both trained actor and critic net-
works, enhancing the stability and effectiveness of RL train-
ing.
Iteration between specialist fine-tuning and generalist
distillation. With our proposed DAgger-based distillation
method, we can do the following: 1) start with our first gen-
eralist learned through GeoCurriculum; 2) clone the gener-
alist to several specialists, finetune each specialist on their
own task distribution; 3) using DAgger-based distillation
method to distill all specialists to one generalist; we can
iterate between 2) and 3) until the performance saturates.
4.3. GiGSL: Geometry-aware iterative Generalist-
Specialist Learning
One important question left for iGSL is how to partition
the task space. In [29], they are dealing with a limited
amount of tasks and it is possible for them to assign one
specialist to one task or randomly. However, in our work,
we are dealing with an infinite number of tasks consider-
ing the initial object pose can change continuously. We can
only afford a finite number of specialists and need to find
a way to assign a sampled task to a specialist. We argue
that similar tasks need to be assigned to the same specialist
since one specialist will improve effectively via reinforce-
ment learning only if its task variation is small. To this end,
we propose GeoClustering, a strategy for geometry-aware
clustering in the task space.
GeoClustering strategy.
We split the task space T =
O × SO(3) into Nclu clusters, with tasks in each cluster
Cj being handled by a designated specialist Sj during spe-
cialist fine-tuning. We begin by sampling a large number
of tasks {τ (k)}Nsample
k=1
from T (Nsample ≈270, 000 in our
implementation) and clustering their visual features using
K-Means. The clustering of the large-scale task samples
provides an approximation of the clustering of the whole
continuous task space.
We first train a point cloud 3D autoencoder using the
point cloud {P (k)
t=0}Nsample
k=1
of the initialized objects in the
sample tasks {τ (k)}Nsample
k=1
. The autoencoder follows an
encoder-decoder structure. The encoder E encodes P (k)
t=0
and outputs the encoding latent feature z(k) = E(P (k)
t=0).
The decoder D takes z(k) as input and generates the point
cloud ˆP (k)
t=0. The model is trained using the reconstruction
loss LAE, which is the Chamfer Distance between P (k)
t=0 and
ˆP (k)
t=0. See Supplementary Materials for more details.
During clustering for the state-based specialists, we use
the pre-trained encoder E to encode the object point cloud
P (k)
t=0 for a task τ (k) and obtain the latent code z(k). We
use this geometry and pose encoded latent code z(k) as the
feature for clustering. We then use K-Means to cluster the
features of these sampled tasks {z(k)}Nsample
k=1
and generate

And for vision-based specialists, thanks to the trained
vision backbone, we directly use it to generate feature f (k)
to replace the corresponding encoding feature z(k) in the
state-based setting. Finally, the clustering for specialists can
be formulated as:
During the specialists fine-tuning, we assign a given task
τ (k) to the specialist in an online fashion to handle the infi-
nite task space. During fine-tuning, we assign τ (k) to SSj
or V Sj if the Specialist have the nearest center cj to the
feature z(k). or f (k). Then each Specialist only needs to
train on the assigned task set and distill their learned spe-
cific knowledge to the Generalist.
Summary and Discussion.
GeoClustering strategy re-
solves the problem of task space partition, allows one spe-
cialist to focus on concentrated task distribution, and thus
facilitates the performance gain for each specialist. Please
refer to Algorithm 3 for the pseudo-code of GeoClustering.
As a way to partition task space, our geometry-aware
clustering is much more reasonable and effective than cate-
gory label-based partition, based on the following reasons:
1) not every object instance has a category label; 2) consid-
ering the large intra-category geometry variations, not nec-
essarily objects that belong to the same category would be
taken care by the same specialist; 3) object pose can also af-
fect grasping, which is completely ignored in category label
based partition but is well captured by our method.
4.4. GeoCurriculum: Geometry-aware Task Curriculum
Learning
Problems of GiGSL from Scratch For state-based policy
learning, we in theory can start GiGSL from scratch. One
straightforward way is to directly learn a generalist from
scratch on the whole task space and then improve it follow-
ing G-S-G-S-... steps. However, learning this first generalist
directly on the whole task space using reinforcement learn-
ing would be very challenging, usually yielding a generalist
with an unsatisfactory success rate.
An alternative would be to first learn Nclu specialist, dis-
till to a generalist, and then follow S-G-S-G-... steps. How-

ever, this is still very suboptimal. Given the huge variations
in our task space, we need Nclu >> 1 so that the task vari-
ations in each specialist are small enough to allow them ef-
fectively learn. This large number of specialists would be
very costly for training. Furthermore, because each spe-
cialist is trained separately from scratch, their policy can
be substantially different from each other, which may lead
to new problems. Considering two tasks that are similar
but assigned to different specialists (they are just around the
boundary of the task subspace). Then, since the two special-
ists are trained independently, there is no guarantee that the
specialists will do similar things to these two similar tasks,
which means the policy is discontinuous around the sub-
space boundary. During policy distillation, a generalist may
get significantly different action supervision from different
specialists for those “boundary tasks”. As a result, this dis-
continuity in policy may lead to difficulty in convergence
and hurt the policy generalization toward unseen tasks.
Recap Object Curriculum in UniDexGrasp Following
UniDexGrasp [70], we consider leveraging curriculum
learning to make the first generalist learning easier.
[70]
introduced an object curriculum: they start with training a
policy using RL to grasp one object instance (this object
may be in the different initial poses); once this policy is
well trained, they increase the number of objects by incor-
porating several similar objects from the same category and
then finetuning the policy using RL on the new collection of
objects; then, they increase the number of objects again by
taking all objects from the category and finetune the policy;
finally, they expand the object range to all different kinds of
categories in the whole training objects and finish the final
fine-tuning. [70] shows that object curriculum is crucial to
their performance, improving the success rate of their state-
based policy from 31% to 74% on training set.

GeoCurriculum.
One fundamental limitation in the ob-
ject curriculum used in [70] is unawareness of object pose
and reliance on category labels. Similar to our argument
in the discussion of Sec.4.3, we propose to leverage ge-
ometric features to measure the similarity between tasks,
rather than object identity and category label. We thus in-
troduce GeoCurriculum, a geometry-aware task curriculum
that leverages hierarchical task space partition.
In detail, we design a Nlevel task curriculum that assigns
tasks with increasing level of variations to policy learning
and facilitate a step by step learning. As shown in Algo-
rithm 2, we first find a task τ (kc) with the feature nearest
to the feature center of all sampled tasks and train the pol-
icy (Level 0). Then iteratively, for level l, we split each
cluster in the previous level l −1 into Nsub sub-clusters (30
in our implementation) based on geometry feature z(k) and
find Nsub corresponding centers. We then add tasks that
have features nearest to these sub-centers to the currently
assigned tasks Ci−1. Finally, we get the hierarchical task
groups for the curriculum, that is:
{Cl}Nlevel
l=0 = GeoCurriculum(T)
(2)
During training, we iteratively train the policy under
each assigned task set. From tackling only one task in C0
to all the training tasks in CNlevel, the policy grows up step
by step and have better performance than directly training it
under all tasks.
5. Experiment
5.1. Experiment Setting
We evaluate the effectiveness of our method in the chal-
lenging dexterous grasping benchmark UniDexGrasp [70]
which is a recently proposed benchmark suite designated
for learning generalizable dexterous grasping.

Figure 3:
Comparison between Category-label-based
Clustering and our Geometry-aware Clustering.
Our
state-based clustering is based on the features of the first-
frame point clouds from the pre-trained encoder, while the
vision-based policy utilizes its vision backbone to extract
features for clustering. Due to the vision-based clustering
being task-aware, we also show the grasping poses of the
dexterous hands in the third row.
UniDexGarsp contains 3165 different object instances
spanning 133 categories.
Since the ground-truth grasp
pose generation for pretraining and point cloud rendering
processes are very expensive for UniDexGrasp environ-
ments, we only consider the non-goal conditioned setting
in UniDexGarsp which does not specify the grasping hand
pose. Each environment is randomly initialized with one
object and its initial pose, and the environment consists of a
panoramic 3D point cloud Pt captured from the fixed cam-
eras for vision-based policy learning.
For the network architecture, we use MLP with 4 hid-
den layers (1024,1024,512,512) for the policy network and
value network in the state-based setting, and an additional
PointNet+Transformer [40] to encode the 3D scene point
cloud input in the vision-based setting. We freeze the vi-
sion backbone during the vision-based specialist training.
We use K = Nclu = 20 in our experiments. Other detailed
hyperparameters are shown in supplementary materials.
5.2. Main Results
We first train our method in the state-based policy learn-
ing setting and compare it with several baselines (green part
in Tab.1). We use PPO [55] for the specialist RL in our
pipeline. For these baselines: PPO [55] is a popular RL
method, DAPG [50], and ILAD [69] are imitation learn-
ing methods that further leverage expert demonstrations
with RL; GSL [29] adopts the idea of generalist-specialist
learning which use PPO for specialist learning and inte-
grates demonstrations for generalist learning using DAPG,
but with a random division for each specialist and only per-
forms policy distillation once. UniDexGrasp [70] uses PPO
and category-based object curriculum learning. To compare
our method to these baselines, we distill our final state-
based specialists {SSn} to a state-based generalist SGn+1

plot the success rate of each training step, where green rep-
resents the state-based policy, blue represents the vision-
based policy, hollow points represent the specialist policy,
and solid points represent the generalist policy.
(although we won’t use the latter later). With our proposed
techniques, our method achieves a success rate of 88% and
84% on the train and test set, which is 9% and 11% im-
provement over the UniDexGrasp in the state-based setting.
We then compare our method in the vision-based pol-
icy learning setting with the baseline methods(blue part
in Tab.1).
For PPO [55], DAPG [50], ILAD [69] and
GSL [29], we distill the state-based policy to the vision-
based policy using DAgger [51] since they don’t consider
the observation space change (state to vision) and directly
training these methods under a vision input leads to com-
pletely fail.
For our method, we compare our proposed
whole pipeline “Ours (vision-based)” with the variant of di-
rectly distilling our state-based policy to vision-based pol-
icy using DAgger, namely “Ours (state)+DAgger”. Our fi-
nal results in the vision-based setting reach 85% and 78%
on the train set and test set which outperforms the SOTA
baseline UniDexGrasp for 12% and 11%, respectively.
5.3. Analysis of the Training Process
Geometry-aware Clustering Helps the Policy Learning.
We visualize some qualitative result in Fig.3. The first row
shows a simple way of clustering, which is based on the
object category. But as we analyzed above, this clustering
method has no object geometry information and thus has
limited help in grasping learning. The second row shows
our stated-based clustering strategy, which is based on the
features from the point cloud encoder E and can cluster ob-
jects with similar shapes. And furthermore, in the third row,
our vision-based clustering strategy utilizes the vision back-
bone which has more task-relative information, and thus
the clustered objects have similar shapes as well as similar
grasping poses.
Quatitative Performance Improvement of our GiGSL.
We visualize the success rate of each learning or fine-
tuning step in Fig.4.
No matter whether for state-based
or vision-based policy, the improvement of Generalist-
Specialist fine-tuning and distillation shows the effective-

5.4. Ablation Study
The ablation studies are shown in Tab.2. For state-based
policy learning stage (green part), we analyze the ablation
results as follows.
1) (Row 1,2) Effective of GeoCurriculum. Using our
proposed GeoCurriculum (Row 2) performs better than us-
ing object-curriculum-learning in [70] (Row 1).
2) (Row 2,3) Effective of iterative fine-tuningS. The pol-
icy can benefit from the iterative fine-tuning process and
reach a higher success rate on both training and test set
(Row 3) than a single cycle (Row 2). Also see Figure 4.
3) (Row 3,4) Effective of GeoClustering in the state-
based setting. With the pre-trained visual feature, the tasks
assigned to one specialist are around the same feature clus-
ters and thus are similar to each other. This significantly
reduces the difficulty of policy learning and, in return, im-
proves performance (Row 4), compared to randomly assign-
ing tasks to the specialists (Row 3).
For the ablation studies of vision-based policy learning
stage (blue part), we use GeoClustering in the state-based
policy training by default, and the checkmark of GeoClus-
tering in this part indicates whether we use it in the vision-
based policy learning. We use PointNet [44] if there’s no
checkmark in “Transformer Backbone”.
4) (Row 5,6 & 9,12) Effective of end-to-end distillation.
We find directly distilling the final state-based specialists
{SSn} to the vision-based generalist VG1 (Row 6, 12) per-
forms better than first distilling the state-based specialists
{SSn} to the state-based generalist SGn+1, then distilling
this generalist to vision-based generalist VG1 (Row 5, 9).
5) (Row 6,7 & 10,12) Effective of iterative fine-tuningV.
The policy can benefit from the iterative fine-tuning process
and reach a higher success rate on both training and test set
than the single stage. Also see Figure 4.
6) (Row 7,8 & 11,12) Effective of GeoClustering in the
vision-based setting. By dividing the specialists using the
learned visual feature from the vision backbone of the gen-
eralist, the final performance can be significantly improved
than randomly dividing the specialists (7% and 5% on
training and test set, comparing Row 11 and 12).
7) (Row 8,12) Effective of the Transformer backbone.
The results show that the PointNet+Transformer back-
bone [40] (Row 13) has a better expressive capacity which
can improve the performance of DAgger-based distillation
than using the PointNet [44] backbone (Row 8).
5.5. Addtional Experiment in Meta-World
To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
training strategy, we conduct more experiments in meta-
world benchmark [73], which focus more on state-based
multi-task learning. We use our iGSL method to handle the
MT10 tasks and the results in Tab.3 show that our method
outperforms the previous SOTA methods and demonstrates
the advantages of our training strategy design, which en-
ables iterative distillation and fine-tuning. More details and
results can be found in the Supplementary Materials.
6. Conclusions and Discussions
In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline, UniDex-
Grasp++, that significantly improves the performance and
generalization of UniDexGrasp. We believe such generaliz-
ability is also essential for Sim2Real transfer for real robot
dexterous grasping. The limitation is that we only tackle the
dexterous grasping task in simulation and we will conduct
the real-robot extension in our future work.

Details of GiGSL: During the state-based policy learning
stage, we terminate training when the success rate of the
current policy SSn is only marginally better than the pre-
vious policy SSn−1 (by less than 0.5%). At this point, we
distill SSn to the vision-based policy. In the vision-based
policy learning stage, we stop training when the success
rate of the current policy V Gn is only marginally better
than the previous policy V Gn−1 (by less than 0.5%). We
then use V Gn as our final policy.
Details of AutoEncoder: We train the point cloud 3D au-
toencoder using the point cloud {P (k)
t=0}Nsample
k=1
of the ini-
tialized objects in the sample tasks {τ (k)}Nsample
k=1
. The au-
toencoder follows an encoder-decoder structure. The en-
coder E encodes P (k)
t=0 and outputs the encoding latent fea-
ture z(k) = E(P (k)
t=0). The decoder D takes z(k) as input and
generates the point cloud ˆP (k)
t=0.
z(k) = E(P (k)
t=0)
(3)
ˆP (k)
t=0 = D(z(k))
(4)
The model is trained using the reconstruction loss LAE,
which is the Chamfer Distance between P (k)
t=0 and ˆP (k)
t=0.
LAE = ChamferDistance(P (k)
t=0, ˆP (k)
t=0)
(5)
Details of GeoCurriculum: In our implementation, we
choose Nlevel = 4 and use a 4-stage GeoCurriculum to train,
where the task number is 1-300-900-Ntrain. We also com-
pare different Nlevel and the result can be found in Sec. C
A.2. Details about Baselines
PPO
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [55] is a
popular model-free on-policy RL method. We adopt PPO
as our RL baseline.
DAPG
Demo Augmented Policy Gradient (DAPG) [49]
is a popular imitation learning (IL) method that lever-
ages expert demonstrations to reduce sample complexity.
Following the approach of ILAD [69], we generate demon-
strations using motion planning.
ILAD
ILAD [69] is an imitation learning method that
enhances the generalizability of DAPG. It introduces a
novel imitation learning objective on top of DAPG, which
jointly learns the geometric representation of the object
using behavior cloning from the generated demonstrations
during policy learning. We use the same generated demon-
strations as in DAPG in this method.
GSL
Generalist-Specialist Learning (GSL) [29] is a
three-stage learning method that first trains a generalist
using RL on all environment variations, then fine-tunes a
large population of specialists with weights cloned from the
generalist, each trained using RL to master a selected small
subset of variations.
Finally, GSL uses these specialists
to collect demonstrations and employs DAPG for the IL
part to train a generalist. For a fair comparison, we adopt
PPO [55] for the RL part and DAPG [49] for the IL part in
our implementation.
UniDexGrasp
UniDexGrasp [70] is a two-stage learning
method. In the first state-based stage, they propose Object
Curriculum Learning (OCL), which starts RL with one
object and gradually incorporates similar objects from the
same or similar categories into the training to obtain a
state-based teacher policy. Once they obtain this teacher
policy, they use DAgger [51] to distill it to a vision-based
policy.
B. Experiment Details
As described in Sec.4, we use PPO [55] in GeoCur-
riculum learning stage to get the first generalist SG1, and

in specialist learning stage {SSi}, {VSi} to train these
specialist. In the generalist learning stages SGi(i > 1)
and V Gi, we employ our proposed DAgger-based policy
distillation. Note that we freeze the vision-backbone in the
{VSi} learning stage.
B.1. Environment Setup
State Definition
The full state of the state-based policy is
denoted as SS
t = (Rt, Ot, Pt=0), while the full state of the
vision-based policy is represented as SV
t = (Rt, Pt). The
robot state Rr is detailed in Table 4, and the object oracle
state Ot includes the object pose (3 degrees of freedom
for position and 9 degrees of freedom for rotation matrix),
linear velocity, and angular velocity.
To accelerate the
training process, we sample only 1024 points from the
object and the hand in the scene point cloud Pt.
Action Space
The action space is the motor command
of 24 actuators on the dexterous hand. The first 6 motors
control the global position and orientation of the dexterous
hand and the rest 18 motors control the fingers of the hand.
We normalize the action range to (−1, 1) based on actuator
specification.
Camera Setup
Similar to UniDexGrasp [70], we employ
a setup consisting of five RGBD cameras positioned around
and above the table, as shown in Fig. 5. The system’s origin
is located at the center of the table, and the cameras are
positioned at ([0.5, 0, 0.05], [-0.5, 0, 0.05], [0, 0.5, 0.05],
[0, -0.05, 0.05], [0, 0, 0.55]), with their focal points set to
[0, 0, 0.05]. We fuse the partial point clouds generated by
the five cameras to one scene point cloud Pt.
Reward Function:
We use the non-goal-conditioned re-
ward version in UniDexGrasp [70], and we formalize it as
Figure 5: Camera positions
follows (All the ω∗here are hyper-parameters same with
UniDexGrasp.):
The reaching reward rreach encourages the robot fingers
to reach the object. Here, xfinger and xobj denote the position
of each finger and object:
rreach = −ωr
∥xfinger −xobj∥2
(6)
The lifting reward rlift encourages the robot hand to lift
the object when the fingers are close enough to the object.
f is a flag to judge whether the robot reaches the lifting
condition: f = Is(
∥xfinger −xobj∥2 < λf1) + Is(dobj >
λ0). Here, dobj = ∥xobj −xtarget∥2, where xobj and xtarget are
object position and target position. az is the scaled force
applied to the hand root along the z-axis (ωl > 0).
rlift =
ωl ∗(1 + az)
if f = 2
0
otherwise
(7)
The moving reward rmove encourages the object to reach
the target and it will give a bonus term when the object is
lifted very closely to the target:
rmove =
−ωmdobj +
1
1+ωbdobj
if dobj < λ0
−ωmdobj
otherwise
(8)
Finally, we add each component and formulate our re-
ward function as follows:
r = rreach + rlift + rmove
(9)
B.2. Training Details
Network Architecture:
The MLP used in the state-
based policy πE and the vision-based policy πS consists of
4 hidden layers (1024, 1024, 512, 512). We use the ex-
ponential linear unit (ELU) [10] as the activation function.

Table 5: Hyperparameter for grasping policy.
The network structure of the PointNet in the autoencoder is
(1024, 512, 64). We use the PointNet + Transformer back-
bone in [40] as our vision backbone, where we use different
PointNets [44] to process points having different segmenta-
tion masks (robot, object, entire point cloud). There’s also
an additional MLP to output a 256-d hidden vector for the
robot state alone. All the features from the MLP and Point-
Nets are fed into a Transformer [66]. The output vectors are
passed through global attention pooling to extract a repre-
sentation of dimension 256, which is then provided into a
final MLP with layer sizes [256, 128, feature dim] to out-
put a visual feature, that is then concatenated with the robot
state.
Hyperparameters of Training: The hyperparameters in
our experiments are listed in Tab.5.
Training time: The experiment is done on four NVIDIA
RTX 3090 Ti. The training process consists of 20,000 en-
vironment steps in the first stage of GeoCurriculum and
15,000 environment steps (for every single policy) in other
stages. It needs two days in total.
C. Additional Results and Analysis
This section contains extended results of the experiment
depicted in Sec. 5.
More ablation on GeoCurriculum.
We do additional
ablation experiments on the effectiveness of GeoCurricu-
lum, and the results are presented in Table 6. Specifically,
we compare our proposed GeoCurriculum approach with
not using any curriculum learning and with the object-
curriculum-learning (OCL) method proposed in [70].
Our findings indicate that curriculum learning is essen-
tial for achieving success in the challenging dexterous
grasping task with large variations in object instances
and their initial poses.
Moreover, we observed that our
GeoCurriculum approach, which considers the geometric
similarity of different objects and poses, outperforms the
OCL method, which only considers the category label
of objects.
In addition, we do an ablation study on the
number of curriculum learning stages.
For the 3-stage
GeoCurriculum, the task number is 1-100-Ntrain; for the
4-stage GeoCurriculum, the task number is 1-300-900-
Ntrain; and for the 5-stage GeoCurriculum, the task number
is 1-20-100-1000-Ntrain.
We compared the performance
of SG1 for all the experiments.
Since the performance
of the 5-stage GeoCurriculum is similar to that of the
4-stage GeoCurriculum, we choose the 4-stage in our main
experiment for simplicity.

More ablation study on iGSL For the policy distillation
method used in iterative Generlist-Specilist Learning
(iGSL), we compare our DAgger-based policy distillation
with several popular imitation learning methods, including
Behavior Cloning (we also add a value function learning
to make the process iterative), GAIL [26] and DAPG [70].
We use GeoCurriculum for all the methods and compare
the performance of SGn+1.
Tab.7 shows the results,
which demonstrate that our DAgger-based policy distil-
lation method significantly outperforms other methods.

results of GiGSL. First, we do ablation experiments on
the cluster number Nclu in GeoClustering.
We compare
the performance of the final vision-based policy V Gn for
different Nclu. The results are in Tab.8 which show that
increasing Nclu beyond a certain point does not improve
performance and may even decrease it.

Then, we compare our GeoClustering with random cluster-
ing and category label-based clustering (we evenly divide
all the categories into Nclu parts for a fair comparison). In
category class-based clustering, we pre-train a classification
task on all the objects and their initial poses.
We then
use the feature of the second-to-last layer for clustering
and concatenate this feature to the robot state and object
state in the state-based policy learning. We compare the
performance of the final vision-based policy V Gn for
different methods. The results are shown in Tab.9.
More Results on Meta-World Here we show additional
results on Meta-World [73], a popular multi-task policy
learning benchmark. The MT-10 task consists of 10 diverse
and challenging tasks, such as opening a door or picking up
objects, that require a wide range of skills and abilities. The
MT-50 task set is an extension of the MT-10 task set and
includes 50 additional tasks that are even more complex
and diverse. We The results in Tab.10 demonstrate that our

Additional Qualitative Grasping Results We show more
qualitative results in Fig.6 and Fig.7. In Fig.6, we provide
more results about our GeoClustering in the vision-based
policy learning stage. The vision-based policy V G1 uti-
lizes its vision backbone to extract visual features of the
tasks for clustering. Due to the vision-based clustering be-
ing task-aware, we also show the grasping poses of these
tasks. The results in Fig.6 demonstrate that our approach
can cluster tasks based on the object geometry, pose fea-
tures, and corresponding grasping strategy of the generalist
policy. In Fig.7, we provide several grasping trajectories for
different objects with different initial poses.
