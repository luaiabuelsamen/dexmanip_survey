Fig. 1: DOGlove, a haptic force feedback glove designed for precise teleoperation and dexterous manipulation. It features 21-DoF motion capture and 5-DoF
haptic force feedback. By leveraging action and force retargeting, it enables the teleoperation of dexterous hands for complex, contact-rich tasks, including:
a) without visual feedback, adjusting contact force with a bottle during teleoperation, b) regulating the flow of condensed milk, and c) performing in-hand
rotation by using haptic force feedback to adjust friction.
Abstract—Dexterous hand teleoperation plays a pivotal role
in enabling robots to achieve human-level manipulation dex-
terity. However, current teleoperation systems often rely on
expensive equipment and lack multi-modal sensory feedback,
restricting human operators’ ability to perceive object properties
and perform complex manipulation tasks. To address these
limitations, we present DOGlove, a low-cost, precise, and haptic
force feedback glove system for teleoperation and manipulation.
DOGlove can be assembled in hours at a cost under 600 USD.
It features a customized joint structure for 21-DoF motion
capture, a compact cable-driven torque transmission mechanism
for 5-DoF multidirectional force feedback, and a linear resonate
actuator for 5-DoF fingertip haptic feedback. Leveraging action
and haptic force retargeting, DOGlove enables precise and im-
mersive teleoperation of dexterous robotic hands, achieving high
success rates in complex, contact-rich tasks. We further evaluate
DOGlove in scenarios without visual feedback, demonstrating
the critical role of haptic force feedback in task performance. In
addition, we utilize the collected demonstrations to train imitation
learning policies, highlighting the potential and effectiveness of
DOGlove. DOGlove’s hardware and software system will be fully
open-sourced at https://do-glove.github.io/.
I. INTRODUCTION
Imitation learning (IL) has shown significant promise in ad-
dressing complex manipulation tasks [7, 8, 46, 45]. However,
it often necessitates a substantial amount of task-specific data
to train a generalizable learning policy. Efficiently collecting
and ensuring the high quality of such demonstrations remains a
persistent and challenging problem for the robotic community.
Teleoperation is among the most commonly used methods
for collecting demonstrations, often involving the development
of a wide range of devices tailored to meet diverse data
acquisition requirements. These devices enable the transfer
of human manipulation behaviors to various robotic plat-
forms [13, 12, 6, 10, 15]. However, when it comes to dexterous
hands, their high degrees of freedom (DoFs) and inherent
complexity impose even stricter demands on operational pre-
cision and the accuracy of human motion capture. Hence, it is
crucial to design an intuitive, responsive, and highly precise
device specifically suited for dexterous hand teleoperation
applications.

Vision-based methods are primarily used for tracking the
human hand in dexterous hand teleoperation. A simple ap-
proach involves using RGB cameras [25, 35], but the accuracy
of hand gesture capture is often questioned and may be further
limited by visual obstacles during hand-object interactions.
Motion capture (MoCap) systems [23, 36, 27, 38] provide sta-
ble hand tracking. However, relying solely on visual feedback
for teleoperation makes intuitive control challenging for the
human operator.
Haptic force feedback offers additional perceptual charac-
teristics beyond those provided by vision, such as the ability
to sense an object’s weight, friction, and softness. Integrating
haptic feedback into teleoperation can enrich the feedback
available during interaction and enable the completion of
more challenging tasks. Recently, some commercialized force
feedback gloves [9, 29, 21, 14] have shown promise for
enabling intuitive teleoperation. However, these solutions are
often prohibitively expensive and require significant integra-
tion efforts to work with existing robot learning frameworks.
In this paper, we introduce DOGlove, a low-cost, fully
open-sourced, and easy-to-manufacture haptic force feedback
glove for dexterous manipulation. The glove can be assembled
in hours for a total cost of 600 USD. Key features of DOGlove
include:
21-DoF motion capture: DOGlove features an anthropo-
morphic design resembling the human hand, providing precise
motion capture and a comfortable wearing experience. More-
over, we propose a customized joint structure that integrates a
compact, low-cost yet accurate joint encoder, with the entire
assembly measuring less than 15 mm in thickness.
5-DoF haptic force feedback: DOGlove leverages a cable-
driven mechanism to deliver force feedback to each finger
while maintaining a compact and cost-effective design. Addi-
tionally, each fingertip is also equipped with a linear resonant
actuator (LRA) to provide realistic haptic feedback. This
integration of force and haptic feedback creates an immersive
and responsive interface for dexterous manipulation.
Action and haptic force retargeting: We propose a general
retargeting framework. For action retargeting, the rigid con-
straints of the glove allow fingertip positions to be mapped
from the human hand to the target robotic hand. For haptic
force retargeting, the combination strategy enables users to
perceive contact information during teleoperation.
The resulting system, DOGlove, provides precise hand pose
motion capture and the ability to sense interactions with ma-
nipulated objects. This enables human operators to intuitively
and efficiently teleoperate dexterous hands. As shown in Fig. 2,
it further supports the completion of complex manipulation
tasks. We evaluate the necessity of haptic force feedback
through a user study and further assess the teleoperation effi-
ciency and data accuracy of DOGlove in several quantitative
experiments.
Finally, we demonstrate that DOGlove seamlessly integrates
with existing methods in robot learning. We use DOGlove to
teleoperate the LEAP Hand mounted on a Franka robot arm,
collecting data to train imitation learning policies. To foster
further research, we will open-source the mechanical designs,
circuit designs, embedded code, assembly instructions, URDF
models, retargeting methods, and MuJoCo simulation environ-
ment at https://do-glove.github.io/.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Data Collection from Human Demonstrations
A substantial amount of task-specific data is essential for
imitation learning. In dexterous manipulation, obtaining high-
quality hand motion data is critical for training effective poli-
cies. Prior work includes extracting demonstration data from
human videos [32, 40, 41, 2] and hand trajectories [37, 42].
While these approaches are accessible and have shown promis-
ing results, the significant visual gap between recorded human

demonstrations and the robot’s perception often makes real-
world transfer challenging. An alternative is using dedicated
hardware for data collection to bridge this gap. Hand-held
grippers [33, 8, 26] have proven effective in capturing robot
manipulation data. However, these systems are primarily de-
signed for parallel grippers. Another widely used approach
is MoCap systems, which record human demonstrations and
extract hand motion data. These systems include camera-based
methods [25, 49], glove-based tracking systems [38, 19, 20],
marker-based tracking [48], and commercial MoCap solu-
tions [34, 11]. While MoCap offers high-precision tracking,
bridging the embodiment gap between human and robotic
hands remains a persistent challenge.
B. Dexterous Hand Teleoperation
Collecting high-quality human demonstrations
through
robotic teleoperation systems [12, 6, 10, 15] also plays a
critical role for advancing dexterous manipulation. Existing
research has explored teleoperation from various perspectives,
including leader-follower setups such as ALOHA [46, 47,
13, 1]. However, teleoperating dexterous hands remains a
significant challenge. OpenTelevision [6] leverages VR devices
to capture hand poses and streams the pose information
for retargeting to robotic hands. BiDex [31], on the other
hand, implements a teleoperation system based on commercial
motion capture gloves [21] and leader arms. Compared to these
frameworks and other glove-based systems [19, 20], DOGlove
offers distinct advantages. It eliminates the need for expensive
equipment while precisely capturing fingertip positions and
delivering richer haptic force feedback to the operator. This
system achieves accurate dexterous hand teleoperation with a
low-cost setup, making it an efficient alternative.
C. Teleoperation with Haptic Force Feedback
While recent studies rely on visual information to capture
environmental characteristics, vision alone inherently limits
the richness of available sensory data. In contrast, haptic force
feedback enhances the teleoperation experience by providing
greater immersion and improving perception of the robot’s
status and movement compared to vision-based methods.
Bunny-VisionPro [10] and Liu et al. [20] apply real-time haptic
feedback to enable more accurate manipulation. Xu et al. [39]
build a bilateral isomorphic bimanual telerobotic system using
a commercial force feedback glove [9] to enhance percep-
tion and improve performance in complex tasks. NimbRo-
Avatar [28] and Mosbach et al. [22] integrate commercial
force feedback glove [29] into dexterous teleoperation systems.
However, these approaches rely on specialized or expensive
equipment. In contrast, DOGlove provides a highly accurate
teleoperation system with integrated haptic force feedback at
a significantly lower cost and can be widely used in dexterous
manipulation.
III. GLOVE DESIGN OBJECTIVES
DOGlove is designed to precisely capture human hand poses
and provide haptic force feedback for intuitive teleoperation.
While ensuring these functionalities, the glove is optimized for
accessibility by the research community, focusing on low cost,
ease of manufacturing, and high performance. To achieve these
goals, DOGlove incorporates the following design principles:
A. Low cost
Commercial products such as the SenseGlove Nova [29]
and Manus VR [21] cost more than 5,000 USD, making
them prohibitively expensive for many researchers. In contrast,
DOGlove provides a low-cost solution under 600 USD.
B. Ease of manufacturing
All parts of DOGlove are either readily available for pur-
chase online or manufacturable using standard methods. The
glove’s main body can be 3D-printed using a commodity 3D
printer, while the remaining electronics and servos are easily
sourced. The entire glove can be assembled within 6 hours.
C. Performance Sufficiency
To ensure precise fingertip position tracking, the glove’s
encoders deliver joint angle data with an error range of ±7.2°,
which can be further minimized through careful calibration.
For intuitive haptic force feedback, the servos provide suffi-
cient stall torque to halt human finger movement, while the
haptic engine supports multiple haptic waveforms to enhance
tactile sensations.
D. Low latency
The MoCap system operates at a maximum frequency of
120 Hz, while the haptic force feedback system achieves a
maximum frequency of 30 Hz. Together with the retargeting
algorithm, the system ensures seamless operation at a mini-
mum frequency of 30 Hz, providing a smooth and responsive
teleoperation experience.
IV. HARDWARE SYSTEM
A. Kinematic Design
The kinematic design of DOGlove refers to the use of con-
straints to achieve desired movements, emulating the natural
motion of a human hand. To ensure precise MoCap capabilities
and a comfortable wearing experience, DOGlove are designed
to closely resemble the anthropomorphic structure of the
human hand.
Several studies [3, 4] model the hand skeleton as a kine-
matic chain, represented by a hierarchical structure of rigidly
connected joints. As shown in Figure 3, the kinematic structure
of the human hand primarily consists of two types of joints:
hinge joints and ball joints.
In the index, middle, ring, and pinky finger, distal inter-
phalangeal (DIP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints
are hinge joints with 1-DoF, allowing only flexion-extension
movements. In contrast, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint
is a ball joint with 2-DoF, allowing both flexion-extension and
adduction-abduction movements.
The thumb differs slightly in its structure. The interpha-
langeal (IP) and metaphalangeal (MCP) joints are hinge joints

with 1 DoF, while the additional trapeziometacarpal (TM)
joint is a ball joint that supports both flexion-extension and
adduction-abduction movements. To further enhance dexterity,
an additional DoF at the wrist allows the thumb to perform
pronation-supination movements.
To implement these joints in DOGlove, hinge joints are
modeled as two linkages connected by a rotary joint, with
a joint encoder installed on the rotary axis to capture motion.
Ball joints are designed as a combination of two orthogonal
rotary joints, each equipped with a joint encoder on its
respective rotary axis.
The linkage lengths in DOGlove are designed to accommo-
date the majority of adult human sizes. To achieve this, a stan-
dard human finger length was first modeled, and the glove’s
linkage parameters were simulated to ensure an optimal range
of motion. As shown in Figure 4, improper linkage lengths can
obstruct the natural flexion-extension of the fingers, leading
to discomfort and reduced MoCap performance. Furthermore,
DOGlove features a modular design where all fingers share a
common structural framework. This modularity enables users
to replace linkages with customized sizes as needed, enhancing
both adaptability and usability.
B. Finger Design
As shown in the exploded-view in Figure 3, DOGlove is
composed of the thumb, index, middle, ring, and pinky finger
assemblies, along with the palm base structure. The design of
each finger assembly follows a modular approach, ensuring
consistent structural elements across all fingers.

finger (link f, g) and the glove (link m), restricting finger movements and

bearing, and joint encoder, secured with an M3 locknut. This
design ensures smooth and reliable joint rotation. The main
body of the finger, colored white and gold, is 3D printed using
PETG material for ease of fabrication and durability.
Given the limited space on the back of the human hand,
the finger assembly’s width is constrained to less than 26
mm. Simultaneously, to provide effective force feedback, the
actuator must deliver a stall torque of at least 0.5 N·m.
Additionally, adjustable stiffness requires the actuator’s current
to be regulated. Since the actuator is directly connected to
the pulley system as a rotary joint for MCPB, it is essential
to measure its rotary position in real time to achieve precise
joint angle control. Considering these design requirements, the
Dynamixel XC/XL330 servo motors were selected as the
actuators for force feedback. It fulfills the torque, size, and
real-time position measurement needs, making it a suitable
choice for DOGlove.
1) Joint Encoders:
To integrate joint encoders into the finger linkages, the
encoders must be compact while maintaining high precision.
Additionally, as 16 encoders are required in combination with
5 servo motors to achieve 21-DoF MoCap capabilities, the
cost of each encoder needs to be affordable. Considering
these constraints, we selected the Alps RDC506018A rotary
sensor as the joint encoder. This compact encoder (W11 mm
× L14.9 mm × H2.2 mm) is easily integrated into the 3D-
printed joint structures. The encoder operates as a variable
resistor, changing its resistance as the shaft rotates.
The resistance changes are converted into voltage sig-
nals using a simple voltage divider circuit. Due to the en-
coder’s linear response, the voltage output is proportional
to the actual joint angle. These voltage signals are read
by an Analog-Digital Converter (ADC) module. For precise
conversion, we use the TI ADS1256, a low-noise 24-bit
ADC operating at 30k samples per second. The converted
signals are then sent to a microcontroller unit (MCU), the
ST Electronics STM32F042K6T6, which operates at a
clock speed of 48 MHz. To optimize system performance and
reduce OS scheduling overhead, the STM32’s Direct Memory
Access (DMA) feature is utilized to accelerate joint encoder
readings. Finally, the processed joint data is transmitted to the
host machine via a serial port on the STM32.
The voltage readings are mapped directly to joint an-
gles under the assumption that the supply voltage of the
STM32 (approximately 3.3 V) corresponds to 360°, while the
ground voltage (0 V) corresponds to 0°. Using the ADC output
voltage, the joint angle is calculated as:
αjoint = VADC
VCC
· 360
(1)
The primary error in this conversion comes from the lin-
earity error of the encoder which is ±2% according to its
datasheet. This results in an angular error of ±7.2° when mea-
suring joint angles. To mitigate this, we employ a calibration
process. Using an external high-precision joint encoder, we
map the voltage reading to an actual joint angle, creating a
correction table for each encoder. With this calibration, the
error can be reduced to within ±1°.
2) Cable-Driven Force Feedback Structure:
To provide force feedback on the human fingers, the output
torque of the Dynamixel servo must be transmitted to the
glove’s finger linkage system. As illustrated in Figure 5, the
rotary axis of the servo and the rotary axis of the MCPB
Lg

joint are misaligned. Consequently, a transmission mechanism
is required to transfer the torque effectively.
Although a bevel gear system could serve as a potential
solution, its implementation would require significant space to
accommodate the two orthogonal gears. Additionally, transmit-
ting large torque through gears can cause deformation in the
gear shaft, leading to gear slippage. In contrast, a cable-driven
mechanism offers a more compact design while ensuring stable
torque transmission.
Traditional cable-driven systems typically provide unidi-
rectional force transmission on the tension side, relying on
a spring to generate force in the opposite direction. How-
ever, this approach introduces unrealistic feedback sensations.
While using two servos per finger could resolve this issue, it
would significantly increase the glove’s weight and cost.

Fig. 6: Pulley system of the cable-driven mechanism.
To address these challenges, DOGlove utilizes a pulley
system to provide the bi-directional force feedback, as shown
in Figure 6. DOGlove uses a 0.6 mm stainless steel braided
wire as the cable, chosen for its strength and durability. The
Servo Pulley connects the servo to the finger linkage (Finger
Middle) via the Finger Pulley, maintaining a 1:1 transmission
ratio. To minimize friction during transmission, the Fixed
Pulley is used to redirect the cable’s path. When the Servo
Pulley rotates clockwise, the tension on Cable B increases,
causing Finger Pulley to rotate clockwise. The extra slack
on the Cable A side is taken up by the Servo Pulley A.
Since the finger linkage is fixed to the Finger Pulley, it also
rotates clockwise, resulting in the extension movement of
the MCPB joint. Similarly, when the Servo Pulley rotates
counterclockwise, the tension shifts to Cable A, producing a
flexion movement of the MCPB joint.
This configuration enables bi-directional torque transmis-
sion while maintaining a simple, compact, and cost-effective
design.
3) Fingertip Haptic Feedback:
To further enhance the operator’s tactile experience, each
fingertip in DOGlove is equipped with a tactile actuator.
Traditional
haptic
actuators
include
eccentric
rotating
mass (ERM) motors and linear resonate actuators (LRAs).
Limited by the inertia of the rotating mass, ERM motors
are slow to start and stop, making it challenging to produce
complex waveforms needed for subtle tactile sensations. On
the contrary, LRAs offer linear motion, resulting in a cleaner
and more precise tactile output.
In DOGlove, we use LRAs with a diameter of 8 mm and
a height of 2.5 mm, installed close to the fingertips. These
LRAs provide vibration stimuli by resonating at approximately
240 Hz along Z axis, which is orthogonal to the fingertip
surface. Operating at 1.2 Vrms, the LRAs generate high-
quality haptic waveforms. To fully leverage the potential of
the LRA, we employ the TI DRV2605L motor driver, which
includes the licensed Immersion TouchSense© 2200
haptic library. This driver supports over 100 pre-programmed
waveforms, allowing DOGlove to deliver realistic and refined
haptic feedback.
C. Wrist Localization
In DOGlove, we design a shell with a 1/4 inch screw con-
nector to accommodate external wrist localization devices. For
our experiments, we use the HTC Vive Tracker for real-
time wrist position tracking. However, the design is compatible
with other solutions, depending on the user’s requirement.
V. RETARGETING
A. Action Retargeting
To map human hand gestures to a robotic hand, it is essential
to perform action retargeting, which converts motion data
from the glove into robotic hand movements. This process
addresses both the embodiment gap and motion discrepancies.
Previous studies [38, 11, 34] highlight the significance of
fingertips, as they are the primary contact area during object
interactions. Building on this insight, we apply the 5-DoF
haptic force feedback to the human operators’ fingertips and
adopt a retargeting method focused on fingertip positions.
Our approach combines Forward Kinematics (FK)
to
compute
human
fingertip
positions
and
Inverse
Kinematics (IK) to calculate the corresponding robotic
hand positions. When wearing DOGlove, the human operator
secures their fingertips inside the finger caps. Since the glove
acts as a rigid body, the relative positions of the fingertips with
respect to the glove’s origin can be accurately calculated. With
DOGlove’s anthropomorphic kinematic design and precise
MoCap capabilities, fingertip positions are effortlessly deter-
mined using the glove’s built-in FK. To map these positions
to a robotic hand, we utilize Mink [44], a differential inverse
kinematics library, to generate smooth and feasible motions
for the robotic hand.
A size discrepancy often exists between the human hand and
the target robotic hand. To address this, we introduce a scaling
factor when calculating IK, allowing adaptation to different
robotic hand sizes. This ensures an intuitive teleoperation
experience where the robotic hand naturally mirrors the human

hand’s gestures. For instance, when the human operator opens
their hand, the robotic hand open proportionally. Similarly,
when the human operator brings their thumb and index finger
together, the robotic hand’s thumb and index finger also touch.
This ability for precise fingertip alignment is critical for tasks
like grasping small objects.
In our experiments, we deploy the system on the LEAP
hand [30] in real-world scenarios and test it with various
robotic hands in the MuJoCo simulator. Figure 7 presents the
retargeting results of DOGlove in both simulation and real-
world environments.
B. Haptic Force Retargeting
To provide the haptic force feedback, it is first necessary
to sense tactile or force information at the robotic hand’s
fingertips. This can be achieved using a simple tactile sensor,
such as the force sensing resistor (FSR) sensor [10, 16], or
for better performance, by utilizing an F/T sensor [17, 5] or a
vision-based tactile sensor [43, 18].
In our experimental setup, we install a 1-D force
sensor on each fingertip of the LEAP Hand, with a mea-
surement range of 3 kg and a precision of 1 g. During our
quantitative experiments (Section VI), we identify a com-
bination strategy for integrating haptic and force feedback
that optimizes performance. This strategy along with the
corresponding thresholds and feedback patterns is summarized
in Table I.

Table I: The combination strategy for haptic force feedback in DOGlove.
When the robotic hand touches an object, the force sen-
sor readings increase. To effectively distinguish these signal
from noise, we set the first threshold at 10 g to initiate
haptic feedback. During a user study without visual feedback
(Section VI-A), we observe that human operators are highly
sensitive to force feedback. To create a more realistic expe-
rience, force feedback is applied only after the force sensor
readings exceed 50 g, which serves as the second threshold.
Furthermore, observations from the bottle-slipping experiment
(Section VI-B) reveal that continuous haptic feedback during
teleoperation can create a misleading sensation, interfering
with the operator’s ability to perceive the subtle properties
of the object’s surface. To address this, a third threshold is
set at 100 g, where haptic feedback stops, leaving only force
feedback active.
For
force
feedback,
the
Dynamixel
servos
operate
in
current-based position control mode.
The
force readings from the LEAP Hand fingertips are clamped
to the range [0g, 3000g], and mapped linearly to the KP
gain of the Dynamixel servos. For haptic feedback, we use
waveform ID 56 from the haptic engine library, corre-
sponding to Pulsing Sharp 1-100%.
This combination strategy for haptic force retargeting en-
ables human operators to distinguish object shape, size and
softness without visual feedback. It also improves performance
in complex, contact-rich manipulation tasks. Further details are
provided in Section VI.
VI. EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we use DOGlove to teleoperate the LEAP
Hand [30] mounted on the Franka Robot Arm to evaluate
its effectiveness through a series of challenging tasks across
three key aspects:
• Haptic Force Perception: Without visual feedback, how ef-
fectively can DOGlove assist human operators in perceiving
object properties through haptic force feedback?
;


<!-- page 8 (ocr) -->
• Teleoperation Efficiency: Does integrating haptic force
feedback improve vision-based teleoperation success rates
and reduce task completion time? Can DOGlove enable
human operators to perform challenging, contact-rich ma-
nipulation tasks?
• IL Compatibility: Can the data collected via DOGlove be
leveraged to train IL policies for dexterous manipulation?
Evaluation Setup: To evaluate the effectiveness of haptic
force perception, we conduct a user study (Section VI-A) and
a quantitative experiment (Section VI-B). Teleoperation effi-
ciency is assessed in Experiment VI-C, while IL compatibility
is evaluated in Experiment VI-D.
Comparisons: All experiments share the following compar-
ison conditions, although a subset of these may be selected
depending on the specific task setup:
• Only Force: Force feedback is enabled only when the
force sensor readings exceed 10 g.
• Only Haptic: Haptic feedback is enabled only when the
force sensor readings exceed 10 g.
• Haptic+Force: A combined feedback strategy is applied,
as detailed in Section V-B.
• No Haptic/Force: DOGlove is used solely for MoCap,
with no feedback provided.
• Baseline: AnyTeleop [25], a widely recognized vision-
based hand retargeting method, is used as the MoCap
baseline.

Task: Five untrained human operators participate in this user
study. During the experiment, they are required to distinguish
between five pairs of objects solely through feedback from
DOGlove, without any visual or auditory input (achieved by
wearing an eyemask and headphones). In each trial, a pair of
objects is randomly selected, and users provide their answers
immediately after experiencing feedback from DOGlove for
both objects. Figure 8 illustrates the experiment setup and the
five object pairs, selected based on factors such as shape, size,
and softness.
Metrics: Users’ ability to distinguish object pairs is evaluated
based on their success rate.
Challenges: The five object pairs are intentionally chosen
based on the following considerations:
• Pair 1: Basic Pair, different shape. The ball and the box have
distinctly different shapes (Fig 8b).
• Pair 2: Basic Pair, similar shape, different size. The peanut
bottle and the coffee paper cup share a similar cylindrical
shape, but their diameters differ slightly (Fig 8c).
• Pair 3: Basic Pair, similar softness, different size. The
two toys have similar softness and shapes but vary in
size (Fig 8d).
• Pair 4: Challenging Pair, similar size and shape, different
softness. Two identical bottles are used, one filled with pure
water (soft) and the other filled with carbonated cola, shaken
to increase its hardness (Fig 8e).
• Pair 5: Challenging Pair, similar shape, different size and
softness. A toy cabbage (softer, larger) and a real cab-
bage (Fig 8f).

Table II: Success rates in the user study. All feedback modes perform well
for the basic pairs. For the challenging pairs, force feedback is more sensitive
to softness, while haptic feedback is more sensitive to shape.
Performance: As shown in Table II, even without visual
and auditory feedback, all participants effortlessly distinguish
basic pairs 1-3. For challenging pair 4, most participants can
perceive softness using only force feedback. Some also discern
softness using only haptic feedback by evaluating the duration
of contact during deformation.
For challenge pair 5, when the robotic hand grasps the
softer toy cabbage, it deforms to resemble the size of the real
cabbage. This deformation increases its perceived softness,
making it difficult for participants to distinguish using force
feedback alone.
For both challenge pairs, combining haptic and force feed-
back slightly reduces user sensitivity, leading to a marginally
lower accuracy.
B. Bottle-Slipping
1) Teleoperation w/o Visual Feedback
Task: In this experiment, the human operator must per-
form a bottle-slipping action relying solely on feedback from
DOGlove. A 15-second countdown timer is set for each trial.
If the bottle successfully slips without falling within the 15
seconds, the trial is denoted as successful.
Metrics: The success rate.
Challenges: Without any visual or auditory input (achieved
by wearing an eyemask and headphones), the operator must
determine if the bottle is slipping at the right speed or too
quickly, risking a fall.

b) Rotating and Placing the Carton
w/o Visual
with Visual
Fig. 9: Teleoperation experiments and quantitative results. a) Without visual feedback, force feedback significantly improves the task success rate. With
visual feedback, it enhances precise control. b) In in-hand rotation, the challenge is to slightly release the fingers, allowing the carton to rotate without slipping
out (as shown in the middle two images).
Performance: As shown in Fig 9a, force feedback signifi-
cantly improves the success rate of this task. Additionally,
incorporating haptic feedback further enhances overall perfor-
mance. However, since the fingers of the LEAP Hand maintain
continuous contact with the bottle during the task, haptic
feedback does not provide additional information beyond using
the glove solely as a MoCap device, resulting in the same
success rate for both conditions.
Due to differences in retargeting strategies, even a slight
change in human finger position can lead to a significant
deviation in the LEAP Hand’s movements. As a result,
AnyTeleop [25] struggles to perform the slipping task effec-
tively.
2) Teleoperation with Visual Feedback
Task: Unlike the previous blindfolded experiment, this ex-
periment allows operators to have visual feedback. To further
evaluate the operator’s control ability, they are required to slip
the bottle to a specified distance (9 cm). A trial is denoted
as successful if the bottle slips without falling. Additionally,
We measure the deviation between the actual slipping distance
and the target distance (9 cm).
Metrics: Performance is evaluated using two metrics:
• Success Rate: A trial is denoted as successful if the bottle
slips without falling.
• Slipping Deviation: This measures the difference between
the target sliding distance (9 cm) and the actual slipping
distance, with a smaller deviation indicating greater opera-
tional accuracy.
Challenges: Operators must precisely control the bottle to
achieve the desired distance. While a greedy approach often
causes the bottle to fall and results in failure, a conservative
approach leads to an unsatisfactory distance deviation.
Performance: This task evaluates not only success rate but
also teleoperation precision. To minimize slipping deviation,
operators are instructed to control the LEAP Hand carefully
and optimally. As shown in Fig 9a, similar to previous results,
haptic feedback does not provide additional information and
may even interfere with task precision. However, force feed-
back enables operators to minimize slipping deviation more
effectively. While using DOGlove solely as a MoCap device
achieves the same success rate as with haptic force feedback,
it results in a larger average slipping deviation.

Table III: Quantitative experiment results. Haptic force feedback enables
operators to achieve a higher success rate and a faster average completion
time, as haptic feedback provides contact information, while force feedback
indicates the proper timing for in-hand rotation.
Task: This is a long-horizon contact-rich task. As shown in
Fig 9b, the operator must first pick up the carton horizontally,
then perform an in-hand rotation, orienting the carton verti-
cally before placing it into a small bucket.
Metrics: Performance is evaluated using two metrics:
• Success Rate: A trial is denoted as successful if the carton
rotates more than 45 degrees and is successfully placed into
the bucket.
• Completion Time: The total time taken to complete the
entire process.
Challenges:
• Precise Manipulation: The operator must accurately teleop-
erate to rotate the carton while preventing it from falling.

a) Press and Move Box
b) Pick and Place Teddy Bear
Fig. 10: The imitation learning experiment. (a) The robot must first locate the correct position of the box and then apply adequate force to press it. Excessive
force prevents movement, while insufficient force causes the fingers to slip. (b) The robot must first locate the bear, then open its hand to grasp it. Due to the
bear’s size, precise grasping control is required. An inaccurate grasp deforms the bear and causes it to slip out of the fingertips.
• Visual Obstacle: Grasping the carton is hindered by visual
obstacles, as the operator cannot see the contact points
between the robotic hand’s fingers and the carton.
Performance: Table III shows that both haptic and force
feedback significantly improve the teleoperation success rate
and reduce completion time. While force feedback alone
results in a comparable average completion time, haptic force
feedback achieves a higher success rate. The vision-based Mo-
Cap method AnyTeleop [25] struggles with in-hand rotation
in this task.
D. Imitation Learning
We show DOGlove is capable of collecting high-quality
demonstrations. 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) [45] is selected
as our imitation learning algorithm, and we use Realsense
L515 to acquire the point cloud inputs, which are then down-
sampled to 1024 points using farthest point sampling [24]. The
data collected by DOGlove is used to train policies for various
downstream tasks. We evaluate imitation learning performance
on 2 basic contact-rich tasks and 1 long-horizon task:
Press and Move Box: As shown in Fig 10a, the robot must
continuously press down on a box and move it to a specified
target location. During data collection, the box is randomly
placed within a 30×20 cm area, and DOGlove collects 40
demonstrations to train the policy. In evaluation, the box is
also randomly placed in the same area. Across 20 trials, the
success rate is 85% (17/20).
Pick and Place Teddy Bear: As shown in Fig 10b, the
robot must grasp a teddy bear and place it into a designated
box. During data collection, the teddy bear’s initial position is
randomized within a 30×20 cm area, and DOGlove collects
40 demonstrations to train the policy. In evaluation, the bear
is again randomly placed in the same area. Across 20 trials,
the success rate is 70% (14/20), with failures primarily due
to the teddy bear slipping out of the robotic hand when not
grasped firmly.
Rotating and Placing the Carton. This task follows the same
setup as Section VI-C. For this contact-rich task, we use 3
human-collected demonstrations to train the policy. Across 10
trials, the success rate is 90% (9/10).
VII. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
DOGlove is a powerful haptic force feedback glove for
dexterous manipulation, but several limitations remain. First,
the weight of DOGlove is inevitably high, as it utilizes 5 com-
mercial servos, bringing the total weight to 550g. Additionally,
in agile teleoperation scenarios, performance is constrained
by the servos’ maximum speed and torque output. To address
these issues, we are investigating the use of lighter servos with
smaller reduction ratios and designing a customized reduction
mechanism to balance speed and torque more effectively.
Second, although DOGlove is designed to accommodate most
hand sizes, it may be uncomfortable for some users. To
enhance adaptability and wearability, we are developing CAD
files for linkages in multiple sizes, enabling customization for
various hand dimensions.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present DOGlove, a low-cost, open-
source haptic force feedback glove designed for dexterous
manipulation. DOGlove enables precise and efficient execution
of long-horizon, contact-rich tasks. Experimental results show
that DOGlove enhances the operator’s immersive teleoperation
experience while also serving as an effective tool for training
imitation learning policies. Moreover, the user study demon-
strates that DOGlove provides precise perception of object
properties through its integrated haptic force feedback. To
support further research and contribute to the community, all
hardware designs and code will be open-sourced.
