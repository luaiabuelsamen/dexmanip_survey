Abstract— In-hand manipulation allows multi-fingered dex-
terous hands to reconfigure grasped objects without releasing
and regrasping them. This improves manipulation efficiency
by reducing repeated grasp acquisition and large arm motions.
However, most learning-based methods focus on reorientation,
continuous rotation, or translation, whereas many tasks require
joint control of object position and orientation. We formulate
this capability as in-hand 6D object pose reaching: starting from
an existing grasp, coordinated finger motions move the object to
a palm-relative target pose. We present POISE (Palm-relative
Object reaching In SE(3)), a sim-to-real reinforcement learning
framework for this task. POISE combines diverse stable-
grasp initialization, goal- and geometry-conditioned control, an
adaptive 6D goal curriculum, and a compact reward scheme
for pose reaching and grasp preservation. In simulation, diverse
initialization raises held-out-grasp success from 40.1% to 51.5%
and post-drop recovery from 33.8% to 72.9%; the curriculum
raises full-range success from 6.2% to 59.5%. On hardware,
the grasp-maintenance reward improves three-target sequence
success from 20% to 80%. In real-world experiments, POISE
reaches successive 6D targets without manual reset across
multiple object geometries and wrist orientations, and recovers
from external disturbances. To support further research in
dexterous manipulation, we will release our code at https:

I. INTRODUCTION
Many manipulation tasks begin, rather than end, once an
object has been grasped. While parallel-jaw grippers are
effective for establishing stable grasps, they have limited
ability to reconfigure an object after grasp acquisition. High-
degree-of-freedom dexterous hands, in contrast, can continue

to manipulate a grasped object through coordinated multi-
finger motions. This in-hand dexterity is crucial when a
robot needs to shift the grasping region on a tool, expose
a desired contact surface, or align a functional axis with the
environment.
We formulate this capability as in-hand 6D object pose
reaching: given a grasped object and a random target pose
defined relative to the hand in the special Euclidean group
SE(3), a single multi-fingered dexterous hand must bring
the object to the target using only in-hand manipulation.
Unlike in-hand reorientation or translation-only tasks [1, 2],
this formulation jointly constrains the object’s relative 3D
translation and 3D rotation. This coupled objective signifi-
cantly constrains the feasible motion space and often requires
contact switching or finger gaiting while maintaining a stable
grasp. Successive reaching further requires each attained
object pose to be supported by a grasp that permits continued
manipulation.
Prior work has addressed aspects of this problem from
two main directions. Model-based methods can achieve
accurate local in-hand pose control, but they often rely
on predefined contact modes, fixed contact sequences, or
known and simplified object geometry [3]. As a result, they
do not readily scale to random SE(3) reaching, where the
hand must actively switch contacts and adapt to diverse
object shapes. Reinforcement learning (RL), on the other
hand, has become a powerful tool for dexterous in-hand
manipulation because it can discover contact-rich behaviors
without requiring high-quality demonstrations, which are
difficult to acquire for such tasks. However, most learning-

based in-hand manipulation work focuses on reorientation,
continuous rotation, or constrained translation [1, 2, 4, 5].
Prior full-pose in-hand reaching methods remain confined to
object-specific simulation [6, 7].
To bridge these gaps, we develop POISE (Palm-relative
Object reaching In SE(3)), a sim-to-real RL framework
based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [8]. POISE
comprises five components: diverse physics-validated stable-
grasp resets for broad state coverage; a goal- and geometry-
conditioned policy for shape-dependent control; an adaptive
6D goal curriculum for learning large pose changes; a com-
pact reward scheme that combines pose reaching, goal com-
pletion, grasp maintenance, and regularization; and domain
randomization for robust sim-to-real transfer. Experiments
demonstrate generalization across initial grasps, recovery
after the original grasp is lost, and continued 6D reaching
across multiple object geometries and wrist orientations.
The main contributions of this letter are as follows:
1) A diverse, physics-validated stable-grasp initialization
that improves generalization to unseen grasps and
recovery after the original grasp is lost.
2) An RL recipe for in-hand 6D pose reaching that
combines geometry-conditioned control and adaptive
goal curricula with a grasp-maintenance reward based
on balanced wrench coverage.
3) Real-world validation of successive 6D reaching across
object geometries and wrist orientations, including
disturbance recovery and a quantitative evaluation of
the grasp-maintenance reward.
II. RELATED WORK
Dexterous in-hand manipulation has been extensively stud-
ied, from early analyses of rolling and finger gaiting [9] to
modern model-based and learning-based approaches. Model-
based methods compute manipulation motions from explicit
models of hand kinematics, fingertip contacts, and object mo-
tion. Motion-cone planning derives feasible object motions
from contact constraints [10], while trajectory optimization
and multi-modal planning coordinate in-grasp motion, finger
gaiting, and compliant contact transitions [3, 11]. Model
predictive control instead plans over locally identified or
contact-implicit dynamics [12]–[14]. These approaches can
enforce physical and kinematic constraints directly, but often
depend on accurate models, predefined contact modes, or
time-consuming online optimization. Extending them to a
broad range of 6D goals and object geometries remains
challenging.
Learning-based methods instead discover contact-rich
multi-finger coordination through trial-and-error interac-
tion [15]–[18]. RL has enabled real-world reorientation,
continuous rotation, and constrained translation [1, 2, 4, 19]–
[27]. Recent work further improves generalization across
object geometry through visual or explicit shape condition-
ing [5, 28, 29]. Nevertheless, most of these methods control
orientation or a constrained translational motion rather than
a general 6D target pose.
Closest to our setting, Plappert et al. [6] introduced
goal-pose-conditioned RL simulation environments for in-
hand manipulation of block, egg, and pen objects. Initial
solutions to these challenging tasks achieved only low suc-
cess rates; Charlesworth and Montana [7] later improved
performance using offline trajectory optimization, but still
only in simulation. More recent systems learn 6D object pose
reaching through joint arm–hand control toward world-frame
goals [30]–[32]. Other controllers track human or synthetic
hand–object reference motions [33]–[36]. In contrast, POISE
reaches palm-relative SE(3) object goals through finger
motions alone, without hand-motion references.
III. PROBLEM FORMULATION
We consider a fixed-wrist hand moving an already-grasped
object to commanded poses using only finger motions. Let H
and O denote the palm- and object-fixed frames. The current
and target palm-relative poses are HTO,t = (Hpt, HRt)
and HTO,g = (Hpg, HRg) ∈SE(3). Their position and
orientation errors are
ep =
Hpt −Hpg
2,
eR = dSO(3)
HRt, HRg
=
1
√
2
Log HRg(HRt)⊤
F .
(1)
Here, Log(·) denotes the matrix logarithm and ∥· ∥F
denotes the Frobenius norm; thus, eR ∈[0, π] is the geodesic
rotation angle between the two orientations.
We formulate the task as a goal-conditioned partially ob-
servable Markov decision process (POMDP). An MLP actor
receives three-frame histories of the current and commanded
finger-joint positions, estimated palm-frame object pose and
velocity, the gravity direction expressed in the palm frame, a
confidence score for the visual pose estimate, the target pose,
the current-to-target translation and rotation, and an object-
geometry descriptor zO (Sec. IV-B). The critic additionally
receives noise-free simulator states, fingertip states, applied
joint torques, and contact forces. The normalized action
incrementally updates the commanded finger joints,
qcmd
t+1 = clip qcmd
t
+ saat, qmin, qmax .
(2)
A target is reached when both errors remain within their
tolerances for a prescribed number of control steps. A new
target is then sampled without resetting the hand–object state
during training, requiring successive 6D reaches within one
continuous rollout.
IV. METHOD
In-hand 6D pose reaching requires the policy to handle
varied grasps and object geometries, explore a broad range
of 6D poses, and preserve a stable grasp after reaching.
POISE addresses these challenges through diverse stable-
grasp initialization, geometry-conditioned control, an adap-
tive 6D goal curriculum, a grasp-preserving reward, and
domain randomization, as summarized in Fig. 2.
A. Diverse Stable-Grasp Initialization
Because the task starts after grasp acquisition, each
episode must begin from a stable hand–object state. With

world deployment.
only one reset grasp, rollout exploration is largely restricted
to states that the current policy can reach from that con-
figuration, leaving alternative object–palm poses and contact
arrangements underrepresented. We therefore initialize train-
ing from a diverse set of stable grasps.
Following
the
optimization-based
grasp
synthesis
paradigm [37], we generate these grasps using a procedure
adapted from [38]. Object poses are first sampled over a
feasible in-hand workspace. For each pose, we optimize
stable contacts and solve for the corresponding joint
configuration q; the optimized contact forces are then
converted into an executable position-control command
qcmd.
Randomized
contact
search
produces
multiple
postures for each object pose. We then perturb the object
pose, q, and qcmd, and simulate each candidate for 2 s
under gravity and position control. Only candidates that
retain the object are stored in the reset cache G.
Sampling reset states from G makes grasp diversity an
explicit part of the training distribution, rather than leaving
it to be discovered through rollout exploration. We evaluate
its effect on held-out grasps and recovery in Sec. V-B.1.
B. Geometry-Conditioned Policy
Object shape determines which surfaces and edges can
support contact and how finger motion is transferred to the
object. Thus, identical current and target poses can require
different finger coordination for different geometries. We
expose this information through an explicit shape descriptor.
We use the basis point set (BPS) representation [29, 39].
A fixed set of query points is shared by all objects in their
canonical frames, and each entry records the normalized
distance from one query point to the nearest object surface.
The resulting ordered vector zO has the same dimension and
spatial structure across objects.
The actor receives zO together with its observation and
goal. During multi-object training, one actor is optimized
jointly across objects without a categorical identity input; it
must therefore use geometry to adapt its finger coordination.
The BPS dimension is given in Sec. V-A.
C. Adaptive 6D Goal Curriculum
Sampling the full range of 6D goals from the outset
makes early exploration difficult. We therefore use separate
curricula that expand the maximum rotation and translation
magnitudes from 5◦and 10 mm to 180◦and 30 mm,
respectively. Only the magnitudes are scheduled; axes and
directions remain randomized, with the same limits applied
to all targets in a rollout. Targets outside the palm-frame
workspace or intersecting the fixed hand base are resampled.
At each stage, magnitudes are sampled near the fron-
tier, from the exposed range, or at the current limit in a
0.6/0.3/0.1 ratio. When frontier success reaches 0.4, the
rotation or translation limit increases by 10◦or 10 mm. Each
object maintains independent curriculum progress.
D. Grasp-Preserving Reward Design
Reaching the target pose does not guarantee a useful
terminal grasp: the object may be loosely supported or held
by too few contacts to continue manipulation. Our reward
therefore combines pose reaching, verified goal completion,
grasp maintenance, and actuation regularization.
Pose reaching. Using the errors in Eq. (1), the dense pose
reward is

eR > 45◦,
(0.40, 20 mm),
25◦< eR ≤45◦,
(1.00, 15 mm),
eR ≤25◦.
(6)
When the orientation error is large, the position term is broad
and downweighted, allowing translation needed for contact
rearrangement. As the object becomes rotationally aligned,
the reward increasingly emphasizes accurate positioning.
Goal completion. Let st ∈{0, 1} indicate that the object
is retained and lies within both pose tolerances. A goal
is verified only after this condition holds for N
= 20
consecutive steps; ct ∈{0, 1} marks the first step on which
verification occurs. We use
rgoal
t
= 0.5st + 45ct.
(7)
The per-step term encourages the policy to remain inside
the target region, while the one-time bonus rewards verified
completion.
Grasp maintenance. We approximate each active contact by
four friction-cone wrench rays, with moments normalized by
object size. For each force and torque axis, mt,k ∈[0, 1] is
the smaller of the maximum ray projections in its positive
and negative directions. We aggregate the six margins as

axes. Contact contributions saturate with force, preventing
the policy from increasing the score merely by squeezing
harder.
Since attainable quality depends on the object and initial
grasp, the reward preserves quality relative to the episode’s
stable reset rather than using one absolute threshold. Let Q⋆
be the mean quality over the first four control steps, clipped
to [0.08, 0.35]. We define

The reward remains maximal while the initial wrench cover-
age is retained and decreases smoothly as the grasp becomes

dicate a drop. To discourage object loss and unnecessarily
aggressive control, the complete reward penalizes drops, joint
torque, and instantaneous mechanical power:

E. Domain Randomization
Real deployment introduces both dynamics mismatch and
imperfect visual pose feedback. We randomize object prop-
erties, friction, controller gains, and external disturbances to
improve robustness to the former. For the latter, the actor
receives joint and object-pose noise, pose delay, and hold-last
dropouts; object velocities are estimated from the corrupted
pose history. Table I summarizes the ranges.

V. EXPERIMENTS
We use simulation and hardware experiments for com-
plementary purposes. Simulation provides controlled, quan-
titative evidence for the three main design choices: diverse
stable-grasp initialization, the adaptive goal curriculum, and
the grasp-maintenance reward. Hardware experiments instead
focus on system-level capabilities, including reaching across
object geometries and wrist orientations, recovery from ex-
ternal disturbances, and continued operation after reaching.

A. Experimental Setup
Simulation. We train the policies with asymmetric PPO
in Isaac Lab [40]. Physics is simulated at 120 Hz, and
the policy produces incremental joint-position commands at
20 Hz. Both actor and critic are [512, 256, 128] ELU MLPs,
and object geometry is represented by a 64-dimensional
BPS descriptor. Unless noted otherwise, ablations use a 40-
mm Hexagonal Prism and fixed palm-up wrist, changing
only the component under study. A target is considered
reached when the position and orientation errors remain
below 10 mm and 10◦, respectively, for 20 consecutive policy
steps. After reaching, a new target is issued without resetting
the hand–object state. Each episode lasts 400 policy steps and
terminates early if the object is dropped.
Hardware. The real system consists of a 22-DoF Sharpa
Wave hand [41] and a RealSense D435 camera [42]. Foun-
dationPose [43] estimates the object pose from the RGB-D
stream and a known object mesh. A calibrated camera-to-
hand transform expresses the estimate in the palm frame, and
the policy runs in closed loop at 20 Hz. The same observation
and action interfaces are used in simulation and on hardware;
only deployable proprioceptive and visual estimates are
provided to the actor. The domain randomization used for
transfer is summarized in Table I.

the target. The narrow policy (bottom) attempts to regrasp the object but stalls before reaching the target.
B. Quantitative Simulation Studies
1) Generalization Across Initial Grasps: To isolate the
effect of diversity in grasp initialization, we compare the
proposed method with a narrow variant whose reset cache
is obtained by perturbing the joint state and object pose of
a single grasp seed. Each cache contains 6,842 stable reset
states; the conditions differ only in their reset-state distribu-
tions. We test whether this coverage supports reaching from
unseen stable grasps and recovery after the original grasp is
lost.
On independently generated held-out stable grasps, both
policies receive the same initial states and 30-mm/180◦first
targets. Diverse initialization increases first-target success
from 40.1% to 51.5% and the mean number of completed
goals per episode from 0.69 to 1.00. Figs. 3 and 4 further
characterize this gain over the initial object position. Smaller
Z coordinates and the boundaries of the Y range are more
difficult for both policies, while success varies less along
X. The diverse policy has higher observed success in every
marginalized position bin shown, suggesting that the gain is
distributed across the held-out grasp workspace.
The recovery test then examines whether this broader state
coverage also improves recovery after a grasp is broken.
Both policies are evaluated on the same 720 trials, with the
object resting on the palm and no established grasp. For 30-
mm/180◦targets that require lifting the object away from
the palm, diverse initialization increases first-target success
from 33.8% to 72.9%. Among successful trials, the mean
time to recover and reach the target decreases from 11.63 s
to 9.45 s. Figure 5 contrasts representative rollouts from the
same post-drop state and target: the diverse policy rebuilds
multi-finger contact, lifts the object, and reaches the target,

whereas the narrow policy stalls without reaching the target.
Together, the two tests indicate that broader coverage during
training improves both generalization across grasp poses and
recovery after a drop.
2) Effect of the Adaptive Goal Curriculum: We compare
our curriculum with a variant that samples target magnitudes
uniformly over the full range throughout training. Each
training run uses 64,000 parallel simulation environments.
We evaluate the policies from the same stable grasps and
with the same first targets in two suites: full-range targets
with rotations in [5◦, 180◦] and translations in [10, 30] mm,
and maximum-change targets of 180◦and 30 mm.
We report strict first-target success under the standard
10◦/10-mm criterion and near success under a relaxed
20◦/20-mm criterion. The goals-per-episode metric counts
targets completed under the strict criterion before reset.
As shown in Table II, directly training on the full goal
range rarely produces successful 6D reaching. The curricu-
lum raises strict success from 6.2% to 59.5% on full-range
targets and from 3.4% to 55.3% on maximum-change targets.
Near success and the number of completed goals improve
consistently as well. Thus, progressively expanding the goal
range is important for learning large coupled translations and
rotations.

3) Effect of the Grasp-Maintenance Reward: We isolate
the grasp-maintenance reward by setting only the weight of
rgrasp
t
to zero. We independently train each configuration
three times. For each paired comparison, we average the met-
rics over equal-length training windows after both policies
have reached the full 30-mm/180◦goal range, and report the
mean and sample standard deviation across the three runs.
We focus on four complementary metrics. Grasp-wrench
quality Q is the smooth minimum over the six bidirectional
force and torque margins defined in Eq. (8). The minimum
force and torque margins are the weakest bidirectional cov-
erage values over the three force axes and three torque axes,
respectively. Episode success rate is the fraction of completed
training episodes in which at least one target is reached.
Higher values are better for all four metrics.
As summarized in Table III, the grasp-maintenance reward
increases quality by approximately 41%, the minimum force
margin by 39%, and the minimum torque margin by 31%
on average. All three grasp metrics improve in every run.
Episode success rate also rises from 53.7% to 59.1%, a mean
gain of 5.4 percentage points. Thus, encouraging the policy
to preserve balanced wrench resistance improves the result-
ing grasp without sacrificing pose-reaching performance.
C. Real-World Capability Evaluation
We evaluate the complete visual-feedback system on hard-
ware across object geometries and wrist orientations, under
external disturbances, and during continued reaching without
resets.
1) Reaching Across Object Geometries: We evaluate the
real-world system on four objects with distinct manipula-
tion geometries: Cube, Hexagonal Prism, Square Bifrustum,
and Hammer. The first three are drawn from the three
training shape families and sizes and share one geometry-
conditioned policy jointly trained on all nine shape–size
combinations. They differ in symmetry and surface structure
while having comparable scales. The Hammer, measuring
215×50×33.6 mm, further tests the framework on an object
with a substantially larger aspect ratio, moment arm, and
translational workspace. Owing to its elongated geometry,
the Hammer uses an extended translation curriculum of up
to 100 mm, while the maximum rotation remains 180◦.
Continuous random goal reaching. For each object, we
conduct uninterrupted rollouts in which 6D targets are sam-
pled randomly from its feasible workspace. Once the position
and orientation errors remain within their tolerances for the
required dwell time, a new target is issued without resetting
the hand–object system. In each rollout, POISE completed at
least five successive goals without resetting the hand–object
system. The experiment therefore evaluates not only whether

Hexagonal Prism, Cube, Square Bifrustum, and Hammer. The cyan outline
denotes the commanded object pose, and the coordinate frames indicate the
current and target poses.
the policy can reach an individual pose, but also whether
it retains sufficient control of the object for subsequent
reaching. Figure 6 shows one representative reached pose
for each object geometry.
Reaching user-specified targets. We further test whether the
system can follow explicitly specified goals rather than only
targets drawn from the random sampler. For the Hexagonal
Prism, the commanded sequence moves the object to differ-
ent in-hand positions while successively orienting different
prism faces upward. For the Hammer, we prescribe full
6D targets involving substantial translation and changes in
its principal-axis direction. In the representative sequences,
POISE reaches four Hexagonal Prism targets with changes
of up to 35 mm and 100◦, and seven Hammer targets with
changes of up to 93 mm and 180◦. The corresponding mean
times to reach a target are 3.0 s and 2.7 s. In both cases, each
new target is issued from the attained state without resetting
the hand or object. Representative reaching sequences are
shown in Fig. 1.
2) Reaching Under Different Wrist Orientations: We de-
ploy the same policy with the wrist fixed in three orientations,
thereby changing gravity in the palm frame and reducing the
passive support available from the palm. Nevertheless, the
policy sustains continued reaching in every configuration.
In the representative rollouts shown from left to right in
Fig. 8, it completes 7, 5, and 6 successive goals without reset,
with mean reaching times of 5.1, 5.5, and 7.1 s. Across the

Closed-loop recovery from two consecutive disturbances on hardware. After reaching the target, the object is first perturbed in orientation and
then displaced more substantially, changing its contacts. The policy returns it to the unchanged target after each disturbance.

online pose estimates. These results demonstrate continued
reaching under different gravity directions using one policy.
3) Closed-Loop Recovery from Disturbances: We further
evaluate whether the policy can recover from unexpected
disturbances during real-world operation. After the object
reaches the commanded pose, an experimenter perturbs it
twice while keeping the target unchanged. As shown in
Fig. 7, the first perturbation primarily changes the object ori-
entation, whereas the second produces a larger displacement
and a change in the contact configuration. In both cases, the
policy responds to the updated visual pose estimate, reorga-
nizes the contacts, and returns the object to the commanded
pose. This sequence demonstrates closed-loop recovery from
externally induced pose and contact deviations.
4) Hardware Ablation of the Grasp-Maintenance Reward:
We deploy the two policies from Sec. V-B.3 in 10 trials each.
Starting from the same grasp, each policy attempts the same
sequence of three targets without reset; completing all three
defines sequence success. Reach time and steady-state errors
are reported as medians over reached targets, with errors
averaged over the final 20 policy steps.
As shown in Table IV, the reward raises sequence success
from 2/10 to 8/10 and target success from 26.7% to 90.0%,
while maintaining comparable pose accuracy. Without the
reward, progressive contact loss often led to object drops.
The full policy instead tended to retain more distributed
multi-finger contacts, improving the reliability of continued
reaching.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We presented POISE, a sim-to-real RL framework for
reaching palm-relative 6D object poses through finger mo-
tions alone. Our results show that diverse stable-grasp ini-
tialization improves generalization to unseen grasp configura-
tions and recovery after contact loss, while the adaptive goal
curriculum and grasp-preserving reward enable stable, large-
range pose reaching. Together, these findings establish palm-
relative SE(3) reaching as a useful primitive for functional
in-hand reconfiguration, with the potential to support tool use
and other downstream tasks as a step toward general-purpose
dexterous manipulation.
Limitations and future work. Two limitations remain. First,
POISE specifies the object target pose but not a desired
hand or contact configuration. The policy may therefore use
effective but unnatural hand postures. Conditioning on both
object and grasp targets could produce more natural, task-
appropriate motions. Second, real-world performance still
lags that in simulation because of imperfect contact modeling
and errors in 6D pose tracking. Future work will reduce
this gap by incorporating online point-cloud observations
through observation distillation, adding tactile feedback, and
adapting from real interactions, for example by learning
residual dynamics.
