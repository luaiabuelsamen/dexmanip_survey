We first curate UniDex-Dataset from egocentric human videos to obtain a diverse, robot-centric dataset for large-scale pretraining. Building on this, we train UniDexVLA, a unified 3D VLA model that is finetuned with task demonstrations and evaluated on challenging real-world tool-use tasks. The policy exhibits strong dexterous capabilities, zero-shot object and cross-hand generalization and significantly outperforming existing VLA baselines.

### **1. Introduction** 

In recent years, learning from demonstrations [6, 7, 13, 27, 58, 67, 74] has become the de facto paradigm for visuomotor control, enabling robots to acquire complex skills and motion patterns. However, achieving general, human-level manipulation under supervised learning remains challenging. Collecting real-robot demonstrations is labor-intensive and scales poorly, creating a persistent data bottleneck. Moreover, most robot foundation policies focus on paralleljaw grippers, while foundation models for dexterous hands remain scarce—even though everyday tool-use often requires dexterous hands and many tasks (e.g., using scissors or spray bottles) are infeasible with grippers. 

Simply porting gripper-based VLA designs to dexterous hands is insufficient. Building foundation models for dexterous hands is substantially more challenging than for grippers. The key difficulties are: (i) dexterous hand data are harder to collect than gripper data, and large, broadly usable pretraining datasets remain limited; (ii) dexterous hands vary widely in DoFs, morphology, kinematics, and appearance, leading to poor transfer of data and policies across hands; and (iii) dexterous hand control is inherently high-dimensional, demanding expressive action spaces and effective learning algorithms. 

To address pretraining data scarcity, we leverage the fact that dexterous robot hands are designed to mimic human hands and often share similar action patterns, while humans naturally generate abundant manipulation data in daily life. Egocentric human videos are cheaper, more diverse than robot teleoperation data and easier to scale. We therefore transform human videos into robot-executable trajectories to build a robot-centric dataset from human activity. However, there are substantial _kinematic_ and _visual_ gaps between human and robot hands. To close these gaps, we (i) introduce a human-in-the-loop retargeting procedure that combines fingertip-based inverse kinematics with interactive adjustment to align robot fingertip trajectories with human trajectories, ensuring physically plausible hand–object contacts; and (ii) mask the human hand in the visual stream and attach the retargeted robot hand into scene pointclouds 

to reduce visual mismatch. 

Following this human-to-robot transformation pipeline, we construct **UniDex-Dataset** by building on open-source egocentric RGB-D manipulation videos [4, 28, 35, 36]. **UniDex-Dataset** is a unified foundation dataset comprising 9M paired image–pointcloud–action frames and over 50K trajectories across eight dexterous hand platforms, covering active DoFs from 6 to 24. To our knowledge, UniDexDataset is the first dataset to span such a broad spectrum of dexterous hand morphologies at this scale. We also provide protocols that allow researchers to contribute new hands or human datasets with minimal effort, continually scaling UniDex-Dataset and accelerating progress on dexterous manipulation. 

To tackle heterogeneous embodiments and highdimensional control, we further define a unified action space, the **Function–Actuator–Aligned Space (FAAS)** , which maps functionally similar actuators to shared coordinates. FAAS provides a function-centric control interface and enables skill transfer across different hands. Building on FAAS, we train **UniDex-VLA** , a 3D vision–language–action policy pretrained on UniDex-Dataset and finetuned with task demonstrations, serving as a foundation model that supports diverse dexterous hands. In addition, we design a portable human-data capture setup, **UniDex-Cap** , which records synchronized RGBD streams and human hand poses and converts them into robot-centric trajectories via the same transformation pipeline. UniDex-Cap enables efficient co-training on transformed human data together with smaller amounts of robot data, reducing teleoperation cost while preserving performance. 

We evaluate UniDex-VLA on five challenging realworld tool-use tasks across two different hands. Across these tasks, **UniDex-VLA** achieves strong performance, outperforming other VLA baselines by a large margin (e.g., 81% average task progress vs. _π_ 0 [7] at 38%), and demonstrates strong spatial, object, and cross-hand generalization; with FAAS and pretraining, it transfers skills to unseen hands in a zero-shot manner. Leveraging UniDex-Cap, we also provide a quantitative study showing how transformed human data can reduce post-training costs via human–robot co-training. 

Our contributions are summarized as follows: 

- **UniDex-Dataset:** a unified, diverse dexterous hand dataset (9M paired frames, over 50K trajectories, 8 hands, 6–24 DoFs) that supports large-scale pretraining toward universal dexterous hand foundation models. 

- **FAAS & UniDex-VLA:** a function–actuator–aligned unified action space and a pretrained 3D vision–language–action model that achieves state-ofthe-art performance on real-robot benchmarks, with strong spatial, object, and cross-hand generalization. 

- **Human–Robot Data Co-training with UniDex-Cap:** a simple portable capture setup and pipeline that support human–robot data co-training; we quantitatively study how transformed human data can partially substitute realrobot demonstrations during post-training, showing that egocentric human videos both scale pretraining and reduce real-robot data needs. 

### **2. Related Work** 

#### **2.1. Dexterous Manipulation** 

Early research on dexterous manipulation was grounded in analytic and classical control formulations [2, 3, 26, 40, 43], and has since progressed toward learning-based methods that enable in-hand reorientation, rotation, and grasping [1, 10, 17, 19, 22, 24, 31, 45, 50, 54, 62, 65, 70, 75, 76]. Despite these advances, most approaches are tailored to specific tasks (grasping) or hardware and struggle to generalize to everyday tool-use. In contrast, we present UniDexVLA, a foundation model aimed at general-purpose dexterous hand control. 

#### **2.2. Robot Foundation Policies and Unified Action Space** 

Diffusion-based policies and their variants constitute strong imitation-learning baselines [13, 51, 57, 58, 67]. With the rise of LLMs and VLMs, vision–language–action (VLA) models [6–8, 23, 27, 33, 39, 71–73] further scale imitation learning, but most existing approaches are pretrained on large-scale gripper-centric datasets. Recent efforts toward dexterous VLAs [22, 75] leverage simulation or limited real-world data, typically focusing on grasping and relying on hand-specific representations. In contrast, UniDexVLA is pretrained on UniDex-Dataset to serve as a unified foundation policy for more general dexterous manipulation. 

Designing a unified action space for robot foundation policies to handle embodiment heterogeneity is crucial for cross-embodiment generalization. RDT-1B [33] preserves the semantic structure of control signals, while _π_ 0 [7] adopts a left-aligned action representation, and other methods introduce latent action spaces [8, 71]. However, these approaches primarily target gripper-centric actions. EgoVLA [60] attempts to leverage human parameters as a dexterous representation, but requires inverse kinematics in the post-training stage, which introduces additional errors, particularly for high-DoF dexterous hands. In contrast, FAAS provides a function-centric unified action representation that is post-processing-free, enabling more reliable cross-hand skill transfer. 

#### **2.3. Learning from Human Videos** 

Learning from human videos mitigates the data cost bottleneck but introduces visual and kinematic domain gaps. 

Prior work uses human hand trajectories for planning or control [9, 29, 34, 46, 52, 55, 63]; others apply retargeting with sim-to-real pipelines [11, 30, 66] or human-inthe-loop corrections [53], and some co-train with robot data [25, 48, 64, 78] to bridge the gap. However, many such pipelines primarily target grippers or do not scale robustly. There are also approaches that pretrained on egocentric human videos without explicit supervision of hand motion [41, 42, 61, 68]. More recent methods pretrain foundation models on egocentric videos to predict human hand motion, followed by specialized post-training to align with robot actions [38, 60], however these additional alignment stages can be complex and brittle. Our approach instead generates robot-centric dexterous hand supervision for pretraining, removing the need for specialized alignment tricks during fine-tuning while maintaining cross-hand control. 

### **3. UniDex-Dataset** 

#### **3.1. Overview** 

**UniDex-Dataset** is derived from four RGB-D egocentric human-manipulation datasets—H2O [28], HOI4D [35], HOT3D [4], and TACO [36]. We annotate language instructions if needed, segment videos into trajectory clips aligned with those instructions, and filter out invalid segments.

Figure 2. The figure illustrates the complete human–robot transformation pipeline. Starting from the raw scene pointcloud, we first mask out the human hands. We then perform human-in-theloop retargeting through a user-friendly GUI in which the user only needs to **adjust slider bars** to modify the dummy base offset. _⃝_ 1 shows the retargeted result without adjustment, whereas _⃝_ 3 shows the final configuration with improved, more plausible hand–object contact. Finally, after kinematic retargeting, we attach the retargeted robot dexterous hands to the scene. 

The transformation from human data to robot-executable trajectories is illustrated in Fig. 2 and detailed in the next subsection. Applying this pipeline, we construct **UniDexDataset** comprising 9M paired image–pointcloud–action frames (recorded at 30 fps) and over 50k trajectories across

eight dexterous hand platforms (Inspire, Leap, Shadow, Allegro, Ability, Oymotion, Xhand, and Wuji), covering active DoF from 6 to 24. Figure 3 visualizes the verb–object word cloud for the dataset and a subset of the data, spanning diverse daily manipulation tasks such as using a mobile phone, opening a milk carton, and stir-frying with a spatula. Table 1 compares UniDex-Dataset with released collected dexterous manipulation datasets [20, 37, 56] along the axes of trajectory count, hand variety and scene diversity, and supported perception modalities, highlighting the advantages of UniDex-Dataset. Owing to its diversity and robot-centric formulation—i.e., with minimal embodiment gap to the post-training stage—UniDex-Dataset serves as a strong foundation for pretraining dexterous manipulation models. 

#### **3.2. Human-Robot Transformation** 

Transforming human data into robot trajectories requires overcoming two core gaps: _kinematic_ and _visual_ . We outline our methods below. 

##### **3.2.1. Kinematic Retargeting** 

Fingertips are the primary contact points in human–object interaction. Our goal is to align human fingertip trajectories with those of the robot hand in 3D, while allowing a global hand-base adjustment to better ensure physically plausible contact. 

Given a human hand pose, we extract _m_ fingertip targets 



where _m_ equals the number of robot fingers. The global human hand transform in the world frame is _T_ hand. 

To precisely apply fingertip-based IK while permitting a base adjustment, we introduce a _6-DoF alignment offset_ , implemented as a **dummy base** inserted before the real robot base. Let _T_ offset be the rigid transform from the dummy base to the real base, and let _T_ world<sup>dummy</sup> be the dummybase pose in the world frame. The forward kinematics of 

fingertip _i_ is 



where _Ti_ ( _q_ ) is the homogeneous transform from the robot base to fingertip _i_ , and Trans( _·_ ) extracts the translation. We set _T_ world<sup>dummy</sup> = _T_ hand and keep it fixed during optimization. Stacking fingertip residuals yields the IK error: 



For robot hands containing _mimic joint structures_ (e.g., Inspire, Oymotion, Agility), we handle dependent joints through an iterative correction process. After solving the primary IK problem, each mimic joint _js_ is updated from its master joint _jm_ as 



consistent with the kinematic model specification, where _k_ and _c_ denote the mimic constraints. This correction is repeated for _N_ iterations, re-evaluating fingertip error each time until convergence. 

For implementation, we provide a user-friendly and rapid process. The whole pipeline is a two-stage, humanin-the-loop retargeting procedure. 

1. **Automatic stage.** Given an initial _T_ offset, we solve Eq. 3 via PyBullet [15]’s multi-end-effector IK solver to obtain a joint configuration _q_ that minimizes fingertip error while satisfying joint limits and damping. 

2. **Interactive stage.** A lightweight GUI exposes the six degrees of freedom of _T_ offset (three translations and three rotations, as shown in Fig. 2) and other configuration for IK solver. The user visually inspects alignment and manually adjusts _T_ offset; after each adjustment, we re-solve the IK problem. This process typically converges within a few manual tweaks, producing robust fingertip alignment across diverse poses. _⃝_ 1 and _⃝_ 3 in Fig. 2 shows the comparison between and after the interactive stage.

Table 1. **Comparison between UniDex-Dataset and other dexterous manipulation datasets.** UniDex-Dataset advances in total trajectories, variety across hands/actions/scenes, and supports for all perception modalities. ✗✓denotes the pointcloud in ActionNet [20] is very low-quality. 

For each human dataset and each dexterous hand, we perform a basic interactive calibration to select dummy base offsets to handle systematic differences across datasets (e.g., coordinate frames/ hand-pose estimation bias) and hand morphology differences. We then adjust a small subset of frames, focusing on contact-rich segments to improve contact plausibility. In practice, we find the basic calibration suffices to cover the vast majority of trajectories, enabling our transformation pipeline to scale to large egocentric datasets with modest human effort. 

##### **3.2.2. Visual Alignment** 

We compute pointclouds from RGB-D frames. Then to reduce the visual gap, we mask human hands (using WiLoR [44] together with SAM2 [49]) and remove the corresponding points. We then place the retargeted robot-hand mesh into the scene and render its geometry into the pointcloud. Finally, we reproject the fused pointcloud back to the RGB-D frame via a pinhole camera model [21] to avoid occlusions caused by incorrect depth ordering, matching the single-view setting used during real-world fine-tuning. 

### **4. UniDex-VLA** 

#### **4.1. Unified Action Space: FAAS** 

We pretrain our robot foundation model on UniDexDataset, which spans diverse dexterous-hand embodiments. A unified action space that enables transfer across hands is therefore critical. To this end, we introduce a simple yet effective action representation, the **Function–Actuator–Aligned Space** ( **FAAS** ). For any dexterous hand with _n_ actuated DoFs in its kinematic model, each _actuator_ is mapped to the FAAS _index_ corresponding to its functional role. Here we use ”actuator” broadly to denote any controllable DoF/channel derived from the robot URDF, including mimic joints when present. 

Conceptually, FAAS exposes a function-centric control interface shared across embodiments rather than a URDFspecific joint space. Although dexterous hands differ in link lengths, couplings, and layouts, they all implement a small set of functional primitives—such as thumb–index pinch, finger curling around handles, or lateral ab-/adduction for stabilization. FAAS groups actuators by these functional 

roles and maps them into a common coordinate system, discarding embodiment-specific nuisance factors while preserving task-relevant control semantics. Fig. 4 illustrates, for the thumb and ring fingers of different hands, how individual joints are mapped to FAAS indices. 

FAAS is an 82-dimensional action vector. The first 18 dimensions encode wrist poses (9 per hand), where each 9d pose consists of a 6d continuous rotation representation (two 3d vectors for the local _x_ - and _y_ -axes) followed by a 3d translation. and the remaining 64 dimensions encode joint commands, with 32 slots for each hand. Among these slots, we reserve 21 _base_ actuator slots that are shared across all hands, and use the remaining slots for hand-specific DoFs (e.g., additional wrist joints on the Shadow Hand) and for future hands. The details of joint mapping for different hands are shown in Sec. C and Fig. 15 in Appendix.

Figure 4. **Function–Actuator–Aligned Space (FAAS).** We show the thumb and ring fingers of Oymotion (11 actuators), Allegro (16), Inspire (12), and Wuji (20), with colors denoting individual joints, curves indicating rotation directions, and dotted lines indicating rotation axes. Indices _{_ 0,1,3,5,6 _}_ are aligned across all four hands because the corresponding joints share similar functional roles. 

#### **4.2. VLA Policy** 

UniDex-VLA aims to be a 3D, language-conditioned foundation model for dexterous control. Unlike prior VLAs that pair 2D encoders with low-dimensional gripper actions, our setting is inherently volumetric and high-DoF: tool-use requires reasoning about fine 3D geometry and contact affordances, especially in the egocentric single-view observation. By coupling 3D visual inputs with the unified FAAS action space, UniDex-VLA aligns geometric perception and

Figure 5. **Overview of UniDex-VLA.** At time _t_ , the model consumes a single-view colored pointcloud _Pt_ , a language instruction _ℓt_ , and proprioception _qt_ , and predicts an _H_ -step action chunk _At_ = [ _at, . . . , at_ + _H−_ 1] expressed in the unified action space FAAS. Uni3D [77] encodes the colored pointcloud; features are fused with text and proprioception in the backbone and decoded into FAAS actions. The policy is pretrained on UniDex-Dataset and optimized with a conditional flow-matching objective. 

control in a shared representation, supporting spatial, object, and cross-hand generalization. 

##### **4.2.1. Observations and Action Outputs** 

As shown in Fig. 5, the observation at time _t_ is _ot_ = [ _Pt, ℓt, qt_ ], where _Pt_ is a single-view colored pointcloud derived from an RGB-D image and then cropped and downsampled, _ℓt_ is a natural-language instruction, and _qt_ is a vector of robot proprioceptive states. We model _p_ ( _At | ot_ ), where _At_ = [ _at, . . . , at_ + _H−_ 1] denotes an _H_ -step action chunk [74]. Both _qt_ and each _at_ are represented in FAAS. For the wrist in _qt_ , we use an _absolute_ pose; for action outputs, we adopt a _relative_ wrist pose with respect to the first frame of the action chunk, following UMI [14]. For dexterous-hand joints, we likewise use abstracted representations in both _qt_ and _at_ . 

##### **4.2.2. Model Architecture** 

The UniDex-VLA architecture largely follows _π_ 0 [7], with modifications for pointcloud inputs. Specifically, we replace the SigLIP [69] 2D vision encoder in PaliGemma [5] with Uni3D [77], a strong 3D pointcloud encoder. Uni3D adopts a vanilla ViT [18] design and is initialized from a 2D pretrained ViT, aligning pointcloud features with image–text–aligned features. We train the policy with a conditional flow-matching objective and generate denoised action chunks at inference time via forward–Euler integration [32]. More details of UniDex-VLA training are shown in Sec. A in Appendix. 

### **5. Experiments** 

#### **5.1. Experimental Setup** 

**Hardware Platform.** Our real-world experiments use a 7- DoF Franka robotic arm equipped with three dexterous endeffectors: an Inspire Hand (6 active, 12 full DoFs), a Wuji Hand (20 active DoFs), and an Oymotion Hand (6 active, 11 full DoFs), all mounted at the end-effector. An Intel RealSense L515 provides egocentric RGB-D observations

Figure 6. Real-world experiments setup overview 

**Task Description.** Everyday manipulation commonly involves many tools designed for human hands—e.g., scissors, spray bottles, and sweepers—which impose stringent requirements on finger coordination and in-hand reconfiguration. To better assess the dexterity and generality of our approach, we evaluate five challenging tool-use tasks, with visualization of different stages in Fig. 7: (i) **Make Coffee** (Inspire Hand): Grasp the kettle and lift it to the dripper to pour water to make pour-over coffee. Task decomposed into kettle grasping ( **Grasp** ) and water pouring ( **Pour** ). (ii) **Sweep Objects** (Inspire Hand): Grasp a sweeper and sweep tabletop objects into a dustpan. Task decomposed into sweeper grasping ( **Grasp** ) and sweeping ( **Sweep** ). (iii) **Water Flowers** (Wuji Hand): Grasp a spray bottle, lift it, and press the trigger with the thumb to water flowers. Task decomposed into bottle grasping ( **Grasp** ) and pressing trigger to water ( **Press** ). (iv) **Cut Bags** (Wuji Hand): Insert thumb, middle and ring fingers into scissors and grasp them in a human-like manner to cut bags. Task decomposed into scissors grasping ( **Grasp** ) and cutting ( **Cut** ). (v) **Use Mouse** (Wuji Hand): Place fingers on a computer mouse and use it to drag a file into a USB folder in the desktop interface and click the mouse to finish. We report the mean success rate across all task stages as the **average task progress** , which

margin, including on the especially difficult _Use Scissors to Cut Bags_ task. The performance gap between UniDex-VLA (No-Pretrain) and UniDex-VLA further provides a clear ablation of the benefit of pretraining on UniDex-Dataset. Computing relative improvement over the best competing method (Fig. 11), UniDex-VLA achieves the largest gain on the hardest setting, _Use Scissors to Cut Bags_ , with an **84.6%** increase in average task progress. Overall, these results indicate that pretraining endows UniDex-VLA with strong motion priors for dexterous hand control, particularly on highly dexterous tool-use tasks, enabling more efficient adaptation to new and challenging behaviors.

Red and green lines circling regions denote the training placement ranges for the kettle and dripper, respectively. Right: average task progress for different methods (10 trials each). 

serves as our primary metric for comparing methods. **Demonstration Collection.** We build our teleoperation system on OpenTeleVision [12] and dex-retargeting [47] with Apple Vision Pro. We only collect _50_ demonstrations per task for fine-tuning. **Baselines.** We compare **UniDex-VLA** with representative imitation learning and VLA methods: Diffusion Policy (DP) [13], 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) [67], and the strong VLA baseline _π_ 0 [7] pretrained on gripper action datasets. To directly assess the effect of pretraining, we include UniDex-VLA (No Pretrain). We adopt FAAS for UniDexVLA (No Pretrain) and _π_ 0, and retain low-dimensional outputs for DP and DP3. 

#### **5.3. Generalization** 

Beyond outperforming performance, UniDex-VLA demonstrates strong spatial, object, and hand generalization. **Spatial Generalization.** UniDex-VLA benefits from 3D perception, and pointclouds further enable simple, automatic data augmentation via geometric editing. In the _Make Coffee_ experiment, we segment the pointclouds of the kettle and the dripper, and translate them along the table’s _x_ / _y_ axes to sweep across the workspace and generate out-ofdistribution (o.o.d.) placements. After editing the pointclouds, the corresponding robot states are aligned to the new scenes using Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) [16]. DemoGen [59] provides an automated pipeline for this procedure. As shown in Fig. 8, UniDex-VLA generalizes well across spatial configurations; with DemoGen [59] augmentation, it approaches very high success rate over full workspace. 

#### **5.2. Performance** 

We report results on five real-world manipulation tasks across two dexterous hands at Fig. 11. The results show that, with only 50 demonstrations per task, **UniDex-VLA** attains high success rates on these challenging, longhorizon tool-use tasks and surpasses all baselines by a large

kettle with a smaller purple kettle that differs in color, size, and functional parts (handle & spout). **UniDex-VLA** maintains strong performance on this unseen object, indicating generalizable tool understanding capacity crucial for robust and general tool-use. 

**Hand Generalization (Skill Transfer).** We evaluate crosshand transfer by taking a policy trained to _Make Coffee_ on the Inspire Hand (6 active DoF) and deploying it _zero-shot_ on Wuji (20 active DoFs) and Oymotion (6 active DoFs with different kinematics). As shown in Fig. 10, **UniDexVLA** achieves **60%** success on Oymotion and **40%** on Wuji without any fine-tuning, whereas baselines are near zero. These results highlight that pretraining across diverse dexterous hands—together with FAAS—indeed enables zeroshot cross-hand skill transfer. 

#### **5.4. UniDex-Cap for Human-Robot Data Co-train** 

We introduce **UniDex-Cap** , a practical data-capture setup that records synchronized RGB-D streams and hand/head poses. The system combines an Apple Vision Pro for hand and head pose estimation, an Intel RealSense L515 for high-quality RGB-D, and a custom 3D-printed mount to physically couples the two sensors with a fixed rigid transform. This transform is calibrated to ensure the RGB-D stream and the hand/head poses are time-synchronized and expressed in the shared coordinate frame. As illustrated in Fig. 12, we then apply the human-to-robot transformation pipeline (Sec. 3.2) to convert captured human data into robot-executable trajectories. In addition, we perform a viewpoint transformation to align human and robot perspectives and downsample the human motion to match typical teleoperation speeds. 

Leveraging UniDex-Cap, we collect human demonstrations, transform them, and _co-train_ with real-robot data

on _Make Coffee_ task to quantitatively explore the effect of human demos during the finetuning stage. Figure 13 reports average task progress versus the numbers of co-trained transformed human demos ( _h_ ) and robot demos. We observe: (i) **Retargeted human data helps, but robot data is indispensable.** Although for a fixed _r_ , increasing _h_ consistently improves average task progress within our evaluated range but success always remains near zero without any robot data. (ii) **Human–robot exchange rate** _≈_ **2:1.** From Fig. 13, the boundary separating the ”high-performance” region (comparable to the _r_ =50 robot-only result green area) has slope _≈_ 2, suggesting roughly _two human demos can substitute for one robot demo_ . (iii) **Cost efficiency.** On _Make Coffee_ task, human demos are _∼_ 5.2 _×_ faster to collect than real robot demos; considering the _≈_ 2:1 exchange rate, co-training with human demos can substantially reduce data collection cost. 

### **6. Conclusion and Limitation** 

We presented UniDex, a robot foundation suite built from egocentric human videos, comprising UniDex-Dataset, UniDex-VLA, and UniDex-Cap. We believe UniDex can serve as a practical foundation platform for the community, accelerating progress toward general, scalable, and transferable dexterous manipulation. A limitation of our cur-

rent work is that we do not yet leverage large _action-free_ (or weakly labeled) egocentric activity datasets; extending UniDex to incorporate such data is a promising direction for further scaling dexterous pretraining.

### **A. Training Details** 

#### **A.1. UniDex-VLA Flow-Matching Loss** 

To train UniDex-VLA, we minimize a conditional flow-matching loss: 



where _τ ∈_ [0 _,_ 1] and _q_ ( _A_<sup>_τ_</sup> _t_<sup>_| At_) =</sup><sup>_N_</sup> � _τAt,_ (1 _− τ_ ) _I_ � is a linear-Gaussian probability path. We sample _A_<sup>_τ_</sup> _t_<sup>=</sup><sup>_τAt_+(1</sup><sup>_−τ_)</sup><sup>_ϵ_</sup> with _ϵ ∼N_ (0 _, I_ ) and compute the target conditional vector field _u_ ( _A_<sup>_τ_</sup> _t_<sup>_| At_) =</sup><sup>_At−ϵ_.The network is trained such that the</sup> predicted vector field _vθ_ ( _A_<sup>_τ_</sup> _t_<sup>_, ot_) approximates</sup><sup>_u_(</sup><sup>_Aτ_</sup> _t_<sup>_| At_).</sup> 

At inference time, we integrate the learned vector field using a forward Euler scheme to generate a denoised action chunk: 



with step size _δ_ = 0 _._ 1 and initial condition _A_<sup>0</sup> _t_<sup>_∼N_(0</sup><sup>_, I_).</sup> 

#### **A.2. UniDex-VLA Pretraining** 

During pre-training, we use 8 NVIDIA H800 GPUs with a total batch size of 128. The model used for subsequent posttraining is trained for 3 epochs ( _∼_ 30k steps), which takes around 24 hours. We adopt the AdamW optimizer and a cosine learning-rate scheduler with an initial learning rate of 1e-4. The learning rate is decayed by a factor of 0.95 at the 2nd epoch. The weight decay is set to 1e-10, and we apply gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0. 

#### **A.3. UniDex-VLA Post-training** 

During post-training, we use 2 NVIDIA H800 GPUs for each task, with a total batch size of 8. We use the AdamW optimizer without a learning rate scheduler and set the initial learning rate to 2.5e-5. For common data, we train the model for 50 epochs ( _∼_ 3k steps), which takes around 4 hours. For DemoGen [59] augmented data, we train the model for 2 epochs ( _∼_ 1.8k steps), which takes around 2.5 hours. The weight decay is set to 1e-10, and we again use gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0. 

#### **A.4. Baselines** 

For all baselines (DP [13], DP3 [67], and _π_ 0 [7]), we post-train the models until convergence on the validation set. 

For DP [13] and DP3 [67], we use the AdamW optimizer with an initial learning rate of 1e-4. The state horizon is set to 4 and the action horizon to 32. We use a batch size of 32 and train for 400 epochs. 

For _π_ 0 [7], we use the AdamW optimizer with an initial learning rate of 2.5e-5. The batch size is set to 8 and the model is trained for 50 epochs. The number of diffusion steps is set to 10. 

For our UniDex-VLA baseline without pretraining, we use the same training hyperparameters as UniDex-VLA with pretraining. 

### **B. Human-in-the-loop Retargeting GUI** 

To minimum human efforts in our human-in-the-loop retargeting process, we develop a human-friendly web-based GUI, as shown in Fig. 14. Through this interface, users can adjust dummy base links, IK parameters, and other retargeting settings to obtain satisfactory robot trajectories. 

### **C. FAAS Details** 

Here we show the details for the 32 dimensions encoding dexterous hand joints. Dimensions 0–4, 5–9, 10–14, 15–19, and 20–24 correspond to the thumb, index, middle, ring, and little fingers, respectively. Dimensions 25–26 are reserved for extra wrist joints of Shadow hands. Dimensions 27–31 are left unused for new hands. The detailed joint mappings of the robotic hands used in FAAS are shown in Fig. 15.

### **D. UniDex-Cap Setup Calibration** 

UniDex-Cap combines an Apple Vision Pro (for hand and head poses, denoted _{P_ VP _}_ ) and an Intel RealSense L515 (for RGB-D). Because Vision Pro does not expose third-party RGB-D video recording, we physically couple the two sensors with a custom 3D-printed mount that rigidly fixes their relative pose. This mechanical constraint ensures that the extrinsic transform between the Vision Pro and the RealSense remains stable for a given user. 

As shown in Fig. 16, we provide a lightweight GUI to estimate the remaining constant extrinsics with minimal manual effort. The user records a short calibration clip and then uses a slider-based interface to adjust the hand and wrist poses in the Vision Pro coordinate frame—visualized as a skeleton—until they align with the 3D hand point cloud captured by the RealSense camera. The slider values directly correspond to the transform _T_ RS<sup>VP.Once this transform is determined, all Vision</sup> 

_P_ RS = _T_ RS<sup>VP</sup><sup>_P_VP</sup><sup>_,_</sup> (6) 

Pro poses are converted into the RealSense camera frame, yielding temporally aligned hand and head trajectories: 

where _P_ VP and _P_ RS are represented in homogeneous coordinates. This pipeline produces temporally synchronized, geometrically consistent annotations suitable for downstream retargeting and post-training.
